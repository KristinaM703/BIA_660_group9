We only stayed one night but enjoyed our stay. The hotel is one of the cheaper options for decent accommodation in waikiki. Staff are super friendly and efficient.

We stay at this hotel when ever we get a chance to go to Jupiter. There are a lot of fancier hotels in Jupiter that cost a lot more money but I would still prefer to stay at this hotel.

Wonderful place to stay. Just a short walk to everything. Very clean but remember to take the do not disturb sign off your door before 11:00 am or there is no room service.

"This hotel is the best we have stayed at in Baton Rouge -- Large rooms, very nice kitchen with granite and stainless appliances, clean bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries, very comfortable bed with high quality bedding. The breakfast room was lovely with several choices for the hot breakfast, and the lobby was beautiful and inviting -- fireplace, comfortable leather furniture, fresh flower arrangements. Everything was nice, including the landscaping. We were impressed.",1
Great place and very clean.,1
Bad: We arrived later than expected. There was no assistance with the luggage. We had to carte everything to our room by ourselves. No help. Good: Facility is nice.,1
"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager",1
"We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers.",1
"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay.",1
"We really only needed rooms to sleep in, as we were in the area visiting family friends. 2 rooms were booked online by different parties at different times on same night. The young lady who checked us in (around 10 PM, 8-14-15) was great. She put us side-by-side facing the courtyard, which was very nice for visiting with each... More",1

"Clean spacious room, courteous staff, great breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that in addition to the warm breakfast, the Staybridge offered a light dinner Tues. through Thurs. We will definitely stay there again when visiting relatives in Columbia.",1
"First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places. Coffee in the lobby, a newspaper at our door in the morning, and a wonderful whirlpool and sauna to unwind. Also, a fine fitness room.",1
The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view. The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing. Checking in at the tower suites was fantastic. No line ups and very friendly staff. Overall the Hotel is fantastic. Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing. Good central location as well.,1

"Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs.",1
"This was an excellent place to stay when I was visiting my son and his family that lives close by. We stayed for nearly a week and so we took a suite, which turned out to be a great choice for us.

"The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher.",1
"stayed here for a dog show weekend. Really appreciate being able to keep my dog with me here. Grounds are well maintained, but I did step in another dog's feces outdoors...dog bags would be great and a handy trash can. Room was clean and quiet and close to dining and museaums and 81. Bedding was lacking however - thin and even an extra blanket did not help much. Shower rocked and loved having a bathtub. Refridgerator never did get cold and the food I brought spoiled. good breakfast.",1
"After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip.",1

"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",1
The Snow lol in I have to leave there How comfortable the bed in room was really nice I needed the peace in time to myself.,1
Only positives to take away from my stay as short as it was. Regular room was move like a mini-suite. Clean and spacious. Free breakfast was good. Small bar area prevented me from having to leave the hotel. Nice touch.,1
"Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Great location and wonderful service,1
"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location.",1

I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well.",1
Get away to enjoy family yet relax with the sights and sound of surf.,1
"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!",1

"The room was great, but breakfast was not great.",1
"Good: We liked that breakfast was served until 10am. Traveling with young adults and children, it makes for a hectic morning when we have to get to breakfast by 9am. It was a nice, short walk to the Maryland Science Museum and National Aquarium. We were prepared for below average temperatures, so were able to enjoy our stroll around the harbor. We also appreciated that we were able to keep our vehicle parked at no extra cost for several hours past checkout time.",1
"I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad).",1

"Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help.",1

"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay.",1

"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed.",1
There were a lot of people staying there during my stay but the hotel was quiet at night. The couch was getting a little worn and the air conditioning was quiet. The internet worked good. It was an easy trip into Speedway.,1
"Our experience at the Homewood Suite was very good. The hotel was very clean. The room we had was very spacious, it accommodated 4 adults 2 children and a puppy. We are very very happy in our choice to go with the Homewood Suite .. Our next trip to Virginia we will stay at the Homewood Suite.",1
"Excellent accommodations, excellent staff, super super breakfast in the morning, with everything you can imagine. Stay at this hotel you will be happy! Easy access to the highway, easy access to many venues. Very clean, the staff was very welcoming when I arrived!",1
"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards",1
We stayed at the Comfort Inn Ballston at the end of March 2016 and we chose this particular hotel because it was within walking distance of the metro and had free parking. We stayed for 2 nights and would absolutely stay there again. Our room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. I really cant say much negative about our... More,1
Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.,1
Excellent travel and it was a relax place to visit,1
"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay. Check in and the numbering system in the hallways. The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in, understanding that several nights were to be paid... More",1

"The Chocolate Turtle may be the best b b I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Every possible need of travelers was anticipated.

"It's not a 5-star hotel. It's a Motel 6. But it's a Motel 6 right in the heart of Scottsdale, next to the mall, breakfast places, bars, restaurants and clubs with an easy walk anywhere on Scottsdale Road all the way to the ballpark. You know it's a Motel 6 going in. You will get what Tom Bodett says, A... More",1
Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in.,1
"The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool.",1
"Needed a place close to Middlebourne, WV for one night and didn't want to spend a lot for just a place to sleep. Had never used the so called lower end Wyndham hotels, but decided to give it a try. SURPRISE!!! Friendly staff. Asked what floor I preferred After settling in my room, phone rang.. Front desk inquiring if everything... More",1
"I picked this place because the parking was free, big mistake. I do not have anything against this nice place but I believe that i won't stay there again. The rooms are clean, the parking is big, there are many different stores and places where to buy anything around, but is also located in a violent area. It was a great stay that I won't repeat.",1
"This hotel is off exit 63 just off I85 with chick fil a, cracker Barrell, Wendy's, Zaxby's nearby. Our room was spacious and clean. The fold out couch linens were also clean. The room furnishings could stand to be updated, but they served their purpose. We were surprised with the full kitchen in the room. Breakfast was good, tables not... More",1
"It is always the staff experience that provides to customers that's why I like staying at Best Western in Napa. They always do an extra mile and never forget to smile, even the housekeeping they are very polite and always with a smile when they greet you.Armandmariano C - Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review. I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales",1
We stayed at this property two weekends ago for a small family get away. Hotel lobby was nice and the front desk people were pleasant and helpful when asking about local foods in the area. We spend part of the first evening at the bar and the bartenders were very pleasant and poured well for a hotel bar (not over... More,1
A treat to spend first four nights in Maui here. Spacious 1 bedroom with nice amenities. Breakfasted each morning on our lanai as we watched sun rise over distant mts. Very good Snorkeling right at the beach. (But really loved snorkeling at Big Rock a mile beach walk away. Never used the pools but enjoyed one of the several hot... More,1
Bad: Breakfast could have been better. Who likes fake eggs and turkey sausage A bit nasty! We were on third floor when we needed 2- 1st floor rooms. There were a lot of empty 1st floor rooms. A lot of stairs with a lot of luggage and 1 grandma who has leg problems. Good: Beds were great. Very comfortable. Hotel was very clean. Staff was very helpful. Room cleaners did a great job! We were in rooms 339 and 340 for a week. Never saw any bugs! Plenty of towels!,1
"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!",1
"FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience.",1
"Bad: Probably my oversight when Iread the description but I was surprised to find no mini fridge in the room. Good: Close to Colonial Williamsburg, clean with a friendly staff, and two great pools. The pools gave us downtime opportunity on a rainy day as well as on a sunny day.",1
"I stayed at this hotel during a business conference and my stay was Amazing! it is located right in the center of shopping centers, restaurants, and many other attractions. Beautiful hotel beautiful city!",1
My first time here and I absolutely loved it!! We definitely will be coming back!,1
"Bad: There was no non slip surface in the bath or any grab rails in the bathroom, my husband slipped and fell out of the bath while having a shower. Luckily for us he only suffered shock and bruising. . Good: The room was a good size and had tea and coffee making tray. Bed was comfortable and the area quite, which was good after a long flight from uk. Breakfast was also good, a reasonable choice.",1
Bad: The food is too simple. Good: Very quite,1

"Its a good place to stay. i would stay here again. Breakfast was just ok, nothing to rave about. Easy access to property and to find things to do. the bed was confortable and the room was super clean. the staff is honest because i left my credit card in the room and they call me to return it.",1
"Lots of outside sitting areas with ocean views. Great breakfast with many options - fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, cereals, bagels, etc. Very nice setting.",1
"If you don't mind that it looks like your Grandma's spare bedroom, you'll be so happy with this place! It was super clean, very comfortable, and had a lot of unexpected amenities in the room. We had a mini fridge, a microwave, coffee maker, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player. The bathroom was spotless!! I'm a bit... More",1
After a long journey across town we turned up all hot and bothered but when we walked into the hotel lobby we were greeted with a warm smile and welcome. The hotel has free Wifi and parking which we found with all of the budget type hotels in the US. Breakfast was included and kids under 12 eat free. We... More,1
"Pulling into parking lot, motel looks very old. However rooms were spotless and I'm a nitpicker on cleanliness. Owner very accommodating. Priced a little high for the area but beds comfortable. No breakfst but they did offer coffee and donuts in a clean common area as well as very clean laundry facilities. Stay again Probably",1
"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind",1
"Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated. Service was polite and prompt. My room was great: clean comfortable and again, tastefully decorated without looking suburban-generic. Try to get a balcony room if you can. It's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room! Loved the rooftop pool, we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"Except for highway noise, our room was fine. The followup customer service w was exceptional I'd left my purse behind and was 6 hours away when I discovered it missing. Mr Patel went out of his way to get it to me the next day. THANK YOU!",1
We stayed at this hotel during the weekend of our daughter's wedding. It was a convenient location to New Albany Links. The room clean and spacious. Hotel staff were very accommodating. And the shuttle to and from the wedding venue was awesome!,1
"This hotel is not on the beach ( 10 minute walk away ) but overlooks the canal which runs parallel to the beach, 2 blocks back. Initial reaction to this hotel was that it was a bit basic, small bathroom, and probably could do with a makeover. However, when we settled in, our impressions changed and by the time we... More",1
Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious.,1
"My kids and I travel through Harrisburg on our way to see my parents in VA once a year or so. We always stay at this hotel as a stopping point and have never been disappointed. For the price, it is extremely nice. Beautiful lobby, free water and coffee, nice indoor pool, clean and well-sized rooms. Staff is nice and... More",1
"The rooms had a lot of character. We enjoyed the Speak Easy room a lot. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. The room was a bit smaller than anticipated. The walls are pretty thin and we heard the trash man outside every morning, even above the noise maker. Breakfast was good, but simple. We found... More",1
Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.,1
"Good: Spacious, super friendly staff, cleanliness, location, atmosphere",1
Traveled across country..made many stops with our 2 dogs This was the most pleasant.most clean and most dog friendly of all.Would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.Super cozy just like home.,1
Bad: Small rooms Poor and overprized breakfast. Good: Great location,1
"Bad: Need more than 2 small drawers The pillows given were too hard but when replaced w down - perfect!. Good: The breakfast was just enough for busy travelers served on each floor. The cocktails on the 6th floor was wonderful. The rooms were exceptionally clean and the beds were very comfortable The staff Gabriel, Rachel and Drake went out of their way to make our stay wonderful I would recommend this hotel highly",1
"It was very Clean for a great Rate. Sufficient WLAN Speed but not for Free... New modern interior with Flatscreen TV, Fridge, Microwave and Coffee Machine. Free parking. Close to LAX. Will come again soon.......",1
The staff was very friendly and the hotel was spotless! Nice morning breakfast!,1
"We received a pretty good sized snowstorm last night. I live in the foothills of CO and decided last night to stay at a neighboring hotel.

A stop for lunch was fine .,1
I was there from 9 to 13 March and I found the hotel simply perfect. The room was spacious and comfortable. The housekeeper staff very kind...everything was good at Hilton Garden Hill. I hope to come back there,1
"They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler. The pack-n-play was already set up in the room when we got there. The internet was easy to connect and pain-free. The room was clean. Overall a very good experience.",1
This is your basic nice clean hotel. We have stayed here twice due to work in the area and needed a safe secure place to park our work vehicle. The price usually fits our budget and the staff have always been pleasant. Rooms are nice and the location is within walking distance to the beach and lots of dining. We... More,1
"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,",1
"Very helpful and friendly staff, overall a good stay with just a few hickups. Breakfast had a nice variety and overall good. The room was nice and clean except for a large bug that I disposed of. Location was on a dead end street that was odd to get too but OK once you had it figured out.",1
"We have spent a number of nights at this motel. It is always very clean, breakfast above average, friendly staff. When we checked out we mentioned how heavy the bed covers were. We were told we should have requested a lighter cover, as we were not the only ones to talk about this one problem. Great for cold weather. Not... More",1
"Clean and nicely appointed. Rooms are a good size and up to date .. Breakfast is hot with plenty of food that you would expect to see. with a nice cheerful and clean eating area.

"I was very satisfied with this hotel for the price. It offers a breakfast, free internet and an exercise room all included with a decent room that has all of the things to make your stay easier. The exercise room is small and the breakfast has limited options, but for the price is better than several more expensive places that offer neither.",1
"I only stayed here one night. The breakfast was above average. The rooms were clean and quiet. LARGE TV for a hotel room. Comfortable pillows. I felt the rate was reasonable. It was a short walk to the nearby restaurant. That wasn't a problem in nice weather, but it might be a problem in bad weather if you didn't have... More",1
"this beautiful hotel was as quiet, comfortable, charming and accommodating as it was beautiful. the room was all of these things and felt like a home away from home.",1
"Nice room. hot showers, TV a little small, location was nice the breakfast was nice the room needed more usb chargers the AC was ice cold loved it, I would stay there again. More parking spaces are needed for this location",1
"Bad: Hotel is old, need refurbishment. Good: Value for money",1
This establishment took over from the aging but historic Hotel Bellotti. They have remodeled and opened the place up so that you now can see main street and watch the sights and sounds while dining if you wish. They have a balcony as well that is sometime open for service. The wait staff was very attentive and the food was... More,1
"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",1
Bad: Lots of chlorine in the pool area. Good: I really enjoyed my stay there,1
"This place is just a pleasure in every way. Great staff, great rooms and great location. The hotel runs a shuttle to the airport which is really convenient. I love the gym and restaurant. In the heart of Bend and convenient to shopping, etc.",1
"We were visiting family in Gloucester Point and had not been in the area before. While the hotel was probably 10-12 miles from family, it was not a bad drive. Accommodations were great, staff exceptional and I would recommend this hotel without reservation. Much to...More",1
"Great Rates. Convenient Location with plenty of restaurants. Safe Neighborhood. Clean and Comfortable Rooms. Very Friendly Staff. That about does it for a guy like me looking for a low frills travel bargain. Sure you could do better for bigger coin, but you could definitely do a whole lot worse. I've stayed there twice, and just like Arnold, I'll be back.",1
"Very centrally located for shopping and tourism. Clean rooms, fabulous guest extras and friendly staff.",1
"Bad: The entrance was dirty and there is no elevator, there should be someone to carry your luggage upstairs.. Many people were either female or elderly who need that kind of support. Good: Nice staff",1
"Bad: Relatively small lobby. Good: Convenient to Mag. Mile, Loop, Millennium Park and restaurants. Also like continental breakfast brought up to the floor where you are staying.",1
"Love it when we're about to enter the hotel as we drive down to the parking lot. Palm trees, blue skies, ocean... Check in quick as always, clean rooms with nice ocean views, killer hot tubs and pool, ultra-friendly customer service (special thanks to Manny and especially Sabrina!), hot cookies every afternoon, good continental breakfast choices (would like to have...

"Wonderful stay! The hotel was amazing. Modern, superb location, clean and wasn't expecting a full kitchen. The staff was wonderful!! Especially Brennan!! Very helpful! Breakfast buffet is top notch! Create your own omelet!",1
"The hotel is very confortable, besides breakfast they offer wine tasting in the afternoons. The price is a bit expensive and the hotel stay a bit far from downtown Napa, so a car is required. Parking is free, which is a plus.",1
I stayed in this hotel with many of my family members due to a wedding we were attending nearby. Room was spacious and felt really clean.

This is a great place to stay. I have been going there for 7 years and will not stay anywhere else. The staff treats you just like family when you show up. Deny always has a smile on her face no mater how late my arrival. Sylvia and her team have been taking great care of not only me but... More,1
"Very enjoyable. The breakfast was excellent, just get down early. The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and the nightly shuttle offers service to the shops. It was great.",1
"For 18 a night, not much to complain about! Good size room with comfortable beds. The kids like the pool and always enjoy their time here. The Registration staff were fast and helpful. This is an older hotel, but good for the price!",1
"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan",1
Good hotel for a one night stay,1
Everything we ate was fresh and tasty! We had the best stuffed blueberry french toast and make sure you try the pecan chicken. Melts in your mouth!,1
Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden,1
"Very last minute reservation as we finished dinner and started searching for a bed near Kennebunkport. While I don't normally stay at motels, this was a nice surprise. The room smelled like a motel, but was very clean and a fantastic price for the full cabin with 4 beds and a full kitchen. The bed was even comfortable! (I often... More",1
We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days. We needed the car once and it was brought to us in a timely manner. The staff was courteous and helpful. We were spoiled by everyone. Looking forward to staying at the Mills House again.,1
"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay.",1
Bad: Nothing. Good: Friendly and helpful staff. Good food in hotel restaurant. Great location re beach.,1
"Good location, near lot of general shopping and restaurants. The in hotel restaurant is excellent, highly recommended. The staff was very professional and helpful. Will stay here again when in the area.",1

"I have worked at Disney for the last 8 years, so I am very hard to please. We did not have a lot of money to spend on this trip. I was very reluctant to stay in a cheap hotel. To my surprise this hotel was clean, comfortable, the breakfast was great. I will stay at this hotel again. I was pleasantly surprised.",1
"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",1
"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.",1

We stayed at this location one night pre cruise. The air port shuttle was free and arrived fairly quickly. The check in was fast and the staff friendly. The room was clean and quiet.

"Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager",1

"We traveled to Tarpon Springs for two reasons: three business meetings and a dear friend's 75th birthday celebration. The hotel staff members were very nice and helpful. The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations! We will definitely consider staying there for future business and personal trips to Tarpon.",1
I always enjoy my stay at this hotel. It's like my home away from home. If there is ever any issues they will do their best to correct it as soon as possible.

After a night of fun with work mates. It was nice just to go up to my room and not have to drive. But there was airplane noise in the morning since we are close to airport. But it wasn't too bad.,1

"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed. We will share your kind words with our teams and we are so grateful for your support!We hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"I like the renovated hotel for its small size and location to Old Town. Being a renovated hotel, each room had radiator heat and a standing air conditioning unit both of which can be very loud, but provide some white noise so you dont hear the train whistle. Oreo, the house cat, is a nice addition. The front desk staff... More",1

"The room is nice, luxury hotel, nice breakfast. Good location!",1
"Hotel was wonderful. Location, staff, amenities, cleanliness were great. Loved the choice of pools. Two small issues:. Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location. Less than pleasant view, near hotel HVAC equipment which burped and gurgled 24/7, and door to room 5 steps from ice and vending machines.",1
"Beds were a little uncomfortable, but they made up for it with lots of pillows. Woke up with a crick in my neck each of the first two nights, but resolved it by taking the pillows from the other bed and creating my own pillow-top mattress. Problem solved.",1
This is a newly renovated motel. We had a clean room with courteous staff and a nice breakfast. They even mailed me the pills I had left in the room! A good place to stay when passing through the area.,1
Ok has smoking rooms with a nice lounge and bar OTl.................................. ...,1
"Great room. Clean and spacious. Hotel is adjacent to Basic Graduation field, so you don't have to worry about traffic or parking. Nice outdoor pool. Lobby area had plenty of places for families to gather,",1
"Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast. Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults. From arcades, bowling alleys, and cheap gambling. A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip. Also It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining. A very good choice in my opinion!",1
"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too.",1
Felt like home. Would definitely stay here again. Great free breakfast! Very comfortable suites.,1
"When I go to a Courtyard, I always know what I'm getting. Clean, safe, familiar, Starbucks and friendly staff. This hotel did not disappoint and my business trip went fine. Was a pleasant surprise that there was an REI store nearby. I seem to always get a good nights rest at a Courtyard.",1
"Friendly staff, HUGE breakfast, clean rooms, quiet at night, close to the interstate, and shops not too far away for anything else you need. I left behind some keys and the front desk clerk called me 30 minutes after I left, fortunately I hadn't gotten too far down the road so I could come back to get them!",1

I have no complaints.",1
"Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 miles to Sea World, Old Town, and Seaport Village. Double bed rooms do NOT have a sofa sleeper, as indicated when I booked (should be changed by now). We've stayed at several hotels in this chain, and we've always had a sofa sleeper and, usually, queen beds. Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded.",1
"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater.

"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean",1
"This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,",1
"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back.",1

It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal.",1
"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly.",1
"The rooms are comfortable and affordable, but for some reason my account is always screwed up after a stay. I had four charges on my card for some reason. Other than that our stay is always enjoyable.",1
We recently stayed at this fantastic property in Downtown Charleston for a weekend to attend a wedding reception of a close friend's son.

We met wonderful people staying at the inn with us... made the atmosphere very friendly and homey. The staff were an excellent group,... More",1
"Good: I liked the uniqueness of the hotel, and especially the rooms. Great view out our balcony.",1
We had a great stay at the Ritz and would definitely stay there again. Everything was as you would expect.,1
"I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door. However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel.",1
After several trips to Vegas each year for the last several years The Aria remains one of my favorites. Classy place with great features. Very centrally located so you can get to many shows and other casinos.,1
Stayed here many times. Watch bill for automatic safe charge. Will remove if asked to as long as you didn't use it. Don't understand two tax charges. Probably will be here for a couple weeks in Feb. 2016.,1

"Very friendly staff...accomdating and hospitable. Room was decent, but hotel does allow pets and we had 3 yipping dogs across the hall. They did not disturb our sleep, however they barked whenever they heard us going in and out of the room or talking loud in our room.",1
This hotel has everything. Beautiful grounds and interior. Room was very clean with beautiful views room 549. This is a room with a pool view and excellent for watching the fireworks at Epcot and Disney. We stayed here for 3 nights but wish we had booked longer as we didn't have time to make use of the amazing pool area... More,1
"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!",1
"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon.

Beautiful hotel warm and inviting plus breakfast to order in the morning. I would definitely stay here again.,1

I had a great stay. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.,1
"My husband and I stayed here while driving from Florida to Boston for a move. It was our first stay at a Drury Inn, and compared to comparably priced hotels, I thought it was really nice.

"This recently remodeled facility looked, smelled and felt clean and fresh - very modern. The secure parking was easily accessible and security within the hotel itself was excellent. Bed was comfortable, wi-fi was good, and staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.",1
Looks old from the outside but not bad on the inside. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. Baily's the restaurant was nice looking but understaffed at the time. The night shift lady messed up our room reservation but was quick to correct the mistake. The afternoon ladies were unpleasant and not quick to help. Not a bad stay if you don't need much help from the front desk.,1
"We wanted a hotel a little away from the beach to help cut costs. This was a great choice! The hotel was clean, comfortable beds, staff very friendly, and a great continental breakfast. They even had lemon water and cookies available in the afternoons. If we ever go back to this area, I will choose this hotel again!",1
"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again.",1
Wonderful woman at front desk and man working as general maintenance.,1
"I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area.",1
I highly recommend this hotel! I wanted a modern hotel that didn't look like most of the San Fransisco historic hotels. PROS: Clean. Beautiful. Great views. Perfect location. Friendly Staff. Affordable prices. Floor to ceiling windows! Bathtub. CONS: I couldn't find any cons!,1
"Noise from traffic, not very sound proof. TV reception really bad at times Loved the size of the room, the staff were amazing and comfy bed",1
The air blowing from the furnace made the bedroom either too cool or too warm. Other than that I couldn't have been more pleased with every aspect of our stay at Sonesta. Thank you!,1

I have stayed many times at this hotel over the past 20+ years and prefer it to the others I have tried in New Orleans. I have also recommended it to friends and colleagues who were very pleased. It is somewhat pricey but you will not be disappointed.,1

"Quiet and peaceful surrounding neighborhood during off season, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and balcony with view of the beach.",1
"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!",1

"I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great.",1
The hotel staff are very friendly and professional. They went out of their way to ensure that my comfort was their priority. Everything I requested was brought to me in a timely manner. They also gave me my privacy when I needed it.,1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: For a 6 day stay, the space was wonderful",1
The property is nice and well located. The water cooler in the fitness center was unplugged and presumably inoperative indicating a lack of attention to detail. The TV does not give access to Root channel which carries the local sports teams currently the Astros. When I asked about this I was told I could come to the lobby and watch... More,1

"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service.

"This hotel is right on the river, which probably makes it the best one in Yuma.

"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable.",1
This Hilton Garden Inn is perfect. It is in a very strategic location in the city and adjacent to the train. The rooms were very clean and staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again on next trip to Buffalo.,1
This is a very nice hotel in a great downtown location. Accessible to all the attractions and very accommodating. I found it comfortable and clean. I like the complimentary drinks at the door and friendly staff. Our family really felt welcome and enjoyed this hotel the rooms were very relaxing.,1
"Bad: The staff, specially at the restaurant is arrogant and not well trained. The pool area wasnt cleaned in the morning, cleaning ladies came later on and did only the basic to clean it. Rooms in the first floor are noisy and you can hear the music of the restaurant below. A gym would be a very nice to have. Good: The rooftop pool was so nice and with a beautiful view to the sea. Rooms are absolutely cosy. The restaurant is nice furnished and serves excellent food. Excellent location.",1

"Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas.

"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts.

"Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax.

The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels.

"Great stay but if you don't have a car, your cab around would be 15 to the mall",1
"Hotel was not prepared for a busy Sunday night, as expressed by front desk staff. Many of us stood around waiting to get our rooms. Not sure how many got the rooms chosen in their on-line check-in. We did not. Took awhile for clerk to acknowledge it Wasn't the room we had chosen. Even though he argued that it was,... More",1
Another sub-par breakfast menu Jacuzzi was Very Nice.,1
"I believe in the saying you get what you pay for. So, when I came across this hotel (being on a tight budget due to a unplanned 10 hr trip from TX) I booked it and hoped for the best. It was about 30 cheaper then the hotels around it. Although it had great reviews I was skeptical because of... More",1
Great,1
"Our room was spacious, comfortable, and clean.",1
Stayed here while we were in in town seeing a show at the Fox. Short drive to the Fox and to the Galleria. Super close to Forest Park. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. Would definitely stay again!,1
Bad: Was a little too far to walk to the strip. Good: Bartender was awesome got complimentary drinks at bar. Very clean.,1
"Had a great trip. Motel was nice, clean, and comfortable. Food was ok. Taxi/ car to disneyland was only 15 each way. I think the bus was slightly cheaper.",1
Clean hotel with helpful and friendly staff. Pool was great fun for the kiddos! Well lighted parking lot and nice looking grounds. Also had keyed entry's that all worked. Bar area by the front desk where we enjoyed some late night drinks and chatted with the front desk employee. Continental breakfast had a good selection. Close to a McDonald's and... More,1

"Nice hotel, a little way off the interstate, so it isn't loud. Pool was closed - I don't know why - disappointing after a hot day on the motorcycles. Not the cheapest choice, but a newer, comfortable, clean hotel, so a good value.",1
Always great staying here. But i have noticed staff less unfriendly and more rude.,1
"Stayed one night while travel through. Closer to perfection: Hotel was clean, huge room, comfortable beds, temperature, breakfast. Even warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. Price was low, budget price.",1
"Bad: One person a touch too familiar / jokey at reception when checking in and out, but not really a problem. She certainly wasn't rude. Some might think it adds character. Good: Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed. We could shop happily in the Westfield Mall right next door and In Market Street / Union Square.",1
"My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!",1
Bad: Nothing!. Good: The hotel staff were very nice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. Its right at the beach and you even get a couple chairs and an umbrella.,1
"Unbeatable location next to Newbury street. Lovely clean, comfortable room with amenities . Generous continental breakfast.

Good: Staff were all extremely friendly. Hotel was clean.,1
"Beautiful casino and restaurant and shopping district. Vegas always seems to offer a 5 star experience for much less than other cities. I love this hotel and will be back many times in the future. The staff is friendly, the food is t too pricy and the location is perfect.",1
"Wanted a Hotel close to Joshua Tree NP and this one filled the bill being in Twnetynine Palms, Truthfully I picked based on the look of the pool. Checked in and was upgraded to a suite, nice but was a little worried after finding they were at the front of the hotel, no problems the bedroom was at the rear... More",1

"Breakfast staff is second to none, finally someone who is pleasant and truly helpful and a pleasure to be around. He was one of the few I have ever seen that didn't have a grumpy attitude and felt like every thing you did he watched and made you feel bad if you made a mess. superstar!!!",1
It was a great stay,1
"The bathroom was too cramped the room just average. The menus were overpriced and unremarkable. The staff was courteous and responsive to requests. The fitness facility was adequate however, the lap pool is too short and too hot. The locker rooms were exceptional. The access to the Fashion Centre was an unexpected treat.",1
"Regular room--smelled a touch of room freshener. Clean secure, good deal, great location for downtown. Great restaurant across street. Easy to get to commuter train for dwntwn LA (45 minutes).",1
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt after staying at another resort on the Big Island which was lovely, but we were blown away by this facility - Grand indeed!

"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!",1
We stayed for 4 days while we were in town for a friend's wedding. The hotel was surprisingly quiet inside and out. It had a great location right of the main road. Hotel seemed like it was in a nice part of town. Clean room and great breakfast. Our room was nice and the bed was super comfy. We also... More,1

I stay here often and will not stay any place else. Incredibly clean and superb staff. Hotel is in the heart of shopping and dinning. Much nicer than a Hilton or Marriott brand with outstanding breakfast and evening buffets that is included in the very affordable rate. Try it once and I bet you never stay anywhere else while in...

"The Mills House is in a great location in the heart of Charleston's Historic District. There is a parking garage next door w/a walkway leading right to the Mills House. Once we parked the car, we had no need to move it - everything is w/i walking distance. There are several good restaurants also w/i walking distance of The Mills House.We are very pleased w/the accessibility of Hotels.com, the easy and prompt confirmation, and knowing there is someone at hand should we need them.Thank You!",1
The stay was wonderful. Rooms were clean and front desk was very peasant. Good rooms and friendly service. Housekeeping was wonderful.

I stayed there for a week on business. There are three hotels and 4-5 restaurants right off of the expressway. The room was nice. The staff was friendly even when while I was leaving and I accidentally dropped a large bag of MMs all over the lobby near the elevators.,1
Bad: The view. Good: Everything,1

This was a great hotel. Everything was brand new and clean. Friendly staff. Great location. I would highly recommend.,1
"The Colonial Hotel is a really decent place. It's neat, clean, and seems to have the amenities one would expect for the price. We booked both a king and double queen room. The king comes with a fridge and microwave while the queen has neither. Good thing we had access to the king. As a long time Tempurpedic mattress user,... More",1

When we arrived it was exactly how it looked on the website and right across the street from the beach. Upon check in our room as... More,1
Short but good!,1
The Aria was by far one of the best places that I have stayed in Vegas. The rooms were amazing completely controlled by a computer tablet. Never seen anything like it. You walk into the room and it comes alive. The curtains open the TV comes on and plays music. Awesome!,1
"Staff is outstanding! Food at breakfast was always fresh and hot. Staff very helpful for info on local delivery takeout. Only complaint is room lighting. Bathroom especially, trouble applying makeup and shaving.",1
This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!,1
This is a great hotel walking distance to Disneyland friendly staff clean rooms great price will stay again,1
In my view Aria is the best resort to stay at in Las Vegas. Rooms are amazing. The beds and pillows are fabulous. They have the best restaurants too. Check-in is always quick and the employees are always very nice.,1
Great for short business trip.,1
Bad: Breakfast - hardly adequate. Good: Location and value for that location. Easy to get to - right across from bus station to/from Logan airport. Room was small but comfortable and updated.,1
"We stayed overnight to prepare for my daughter's bridal shower. Having a full size refrig was great for storing all the cold food needed for brunch. The room was clean, quiet and smelled great. Easy check in. Would definitely stay here again.",1
We drove in with no reservation and the staff were friendly and helpful. They only take cash or check. oThe kitchen was nice but there wasn't a microwave or cookie sheet. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little soft.,1
Call to get their websiter Get new rooms and low rates toor 10 off for veterans and students,1
"I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking.",1
Just feels old. The parking deck is awful if you drive a truck that is equipped with a taller lift than standard. Check in and Check out is a little crazy and long lined but the rooms are nice and clean. Food is good... little cafe has many options.,1
"We stayed one night here while passing through town. The room was comfy, and the hot breakfast was better than expected. Each member of the staff that we encountered was very friendly and helpful.

"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met.",1
"Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!",1
"I have been staying at this hotel for 15+ years. It has always been a good experience. The staff is friendly and helpful. I look forward to seeing Martine, Gayle, and the kitchen staff each time.

We stayed here because it was close by to friends we were visiting. We were pleasantly surprised by the very comfortable room and bedding. Our bed was plush with many down pillows.The breakfast menu is the best ever. Almost impossible to choose because everything was delicious. The coffee was also very good and the servers helpful and friendly.,1
"Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault.",1
"Very nice hotel. Clean rooms, good free breakfast offered. We had a very nice stay. Good beds and friendly staff. Hotel looks like it is brand new. Close to several restaurants right next door. We felt safe in the hotel.",1

"As a frequent traveler, I have come to view the Hampton Inns as the best value for comfort when away from home. They are uniformly situated, making each nights stay as familiar as my own home.

Good: Perfect location in Chicago downtown. Good value for money.,1
"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room.",1
"When we visit our son in Chapel Hill, NC, we have always stayed at the Hampton Inn and have had an excellent experience every time. The last visit was the exception. Check-in is at 3:00 but our room was not ready until 3:30. The wait was disappointing, but we were given bottled water and treats for the children to make... More",1
"We enjoyed the hotel very much, particularly the free shuttle to/from the airport and metro station and to drop us at a restaurant for dinner. The complimentary afternoon reception and complete breakfast were excellent and enhanced an at-home atmosphere. The rooms were clean and roomy. We would stay here again.",1
"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home. We will share with our team your praises and we are thankful for your visit. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",1
"The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway.",1
Great shower! 24' gym is nice.rooms a little dated.,1
When we walked into the office Yolanda had a big smile on her face and welcomed us into the hotel. We actually live in south Florida but decided to get a room for a friends birthday and she has assured us that we will enjoy ourselves and if we have any questions she is more than happy to answer them...

"Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom",1
"While generally speaking I believe that most next-tier hotels are overpriced, I have been satisfied with this Hampton. The staff is kind and caring for a college town, where mostly I see college-age kids running the desks. The ones at this location, for the most part, seem interested in parent-age people, and they respect that business travel isn't the same... More",1
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",1
"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!",1
"Our room was very clean and comfortable. The beds and pillows were perfect. Teresa, the manager, was very welcoming to us.

"Nice and close to everything. The staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. We had a room that looked out to the ocean at a distance. Nice heated pool. The only thing I can say wrong about the place is rooms do not have microwave or coffee pots, but they do have small items in the office. Nice and clean... More",1
"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general.

For this price and compared to the... More",1
"This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean. Soft bed, clean bedding, modern decor, kitchen with all necessities and clean bathroom. If I return definitely coming back here.",1
Good: We were very pleased with everything.,1
"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!",1
"The facilties are nice , but the room need more cleaning .",1
Good: The hotel was great I loved the room the bed was super clean and comfortable and so was the bathroom.

"This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new.

We have stayed there several times. Very comfortable and relaxing environment.,1
"Friendly desk clerk gave me clear directions to my room and how to use the wifi. The clean room with fridge and microwave was a pleasure, the price a bargain.

I've always stayed at the name brand hotels and didn't see anything appealing about this hotel from their pictures online. I stayed for two nights in a room on the second floor of building 6. The lobby is kind of strange. There... More",1
"First time I've ever stayed here and definitely not the last. We have always stayed at the Whaler, but this time were looking for a condo with better ammenities that was more appealing to our your children. Honua Kai is the perfect mix.

"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town.",1
Rooms were very clean. Staff was very helpful. Hotel in walking distance to restaurants in little Italy. Suggest using parking lot behind hotel. Parking is about 10 compared to hotel valet at 35,1
"Great budget hotel with fridge, microwave, and free wifi. Free breakfast is good but no thrills. Owner is real nice. Great alternative to all the other high price hotels in the area if you need a basic clean place to stay.",1
The staff was very helpful in all aspects of service and provided our family with very helpful service to all the local venue,1
"Was good , clean, and close to places to eat. breakfast not so good.",1
"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time!

Glad we were able to help get you to work on time. Your coming back is what matters most to us!See you then!Evan",1
We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!,1
"I was not familiar with DC. After arriving and using the Metro, the police officers and others told me I was not staying in the safest part of DC. We should have stayed in another Hampton closer to the Capitol.. The metro lines are delayed due to maintenance so we had to wait 20 mins extra during each line change... More",1
"This was our second time to stay at this hotel. Our room was ready when we arrived and the young woman who checked us in was polite. We stayed in a king suite and the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The room did have an odor of cleaning chemicals and musty, but that dissipated after I ran... More",1
"Sirea and Sylvia were awesome, both deserve a raise. Both totally went out of their way to help me with anything I needed. And made my stay enjoyable and not so lonely by striking up conversations with me. Which means a lot when you are away from home. The rest of the staff was wonderful as well. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Will retun.",1
"This was our second stay at ARia. We booked during a promotion which was going to give us an upgrade to a strip view. Unfortunately, we were only able to see a little part of the strip, but who could argue, a strip view it was. Check in/ check out was fast, in spite of a moderate long lineup. We... More",1
Very Nice Hotel very clean. was very close to event. Had good breakfast served in the morning. Was close to shopping for the wife. Lots of restaurant close to Hotel. Easy excess to Highway. Was impressed with the Beds.,1
"nice hotel overall. very clean with good appearance. pool was clean. we only stayed the 1 night. had 2 rooms. very comfortable 2 queen bed room with sofa. breakfast was good. basically the same variety as other hot buffet offerings. packaged muffins, waffle makers, eggs, ham, cereal. wanted a location close to the Globe Life field.",1
This is a nice family owned hotel. It is well appointed but not luxury. The service was exceptional. They could teach a course in hotel service. The staff introduced themselves and remembered our name.,1
"Good Hotel, spent two nights at this hotel in Fayetteville nc. The check in process was a breeze . The nice lady at check in was very nice . She explained the charges and breakfast times . 6am 9am .. They also offer Fresh baked cookies 7pm .. the room was nice they have done major updates ( sorry no... More",1
Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!,1
"The hotel was very comfortable. I was there for one night, and chose it for the location. The staff was very nice and welcoming, the bed was super-comfortable, and I melted right into it. I awoke fresh, had a great breakfast in the lobby, and took the shuttle to the airport. Of course, the shuttle left precisely on time, as... More",1
"This was hands down one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Granted I wasn't spending a lot of time around a pool or in my room but its located nicely and had amazing beds. The most important factor was the customer service. When I pulled into this hotel in my taxi, the staff was out the door to... More",1
Bad: The shower sometimes turned cold and the ironing board was a little too small. Good: The room was very clean and tidy. The location is minutes from south beach and the staff was very friendly even though I only talked to two of them.,1
"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area.",1

Our family spent 4 nights at the hotel while we toured Washington DC. It was an easy walk to the Metro each day and the hotel was clean.,1
"I run an event at Bedford Village every summer and this motel is my go-to favorite. It's clean, convenient (I usually get a room where I can park right outside the door) and the staff are always friendly and helpful.

"My sister I were worried about reviews of kids everywhere pool conditions and smells of a sewerage treatment facility nearby. We were NEVER effected by any of these-found wonderful large 2 BR 2 BA ocean view condo with great concierge, Jesse and free valet car attendants, Ian Leo Don. Would absolutely stay there again!",1
Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.,1
"Modern facility near center of town. Polite, efficient staff. Room was well appointed and clean. There was very little outside noise from adjoining rooms or the floor above. Complementary breakfest was very good. We would stay here again when we are in the area.",1
"Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient.

I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure.",1
"In a very cold night, the Holiday Express offered a warm room great bed and spacious room. In the morning I was delighted with a great smile from Angela who was making sure we had what we needed.

"We were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn. When we arrived, we thought it must be very new, rather than 8 years old, because everything was so clean and fresh.

Nice pillows and TV. That's about all I have. Who much must I type,1
We Had the best time ever! r r What a ball we had at Clarion Resort Waterpark! r r The place was large enough to have plenty of rides but small enough to walk comfortably. r r The entire facility is NEW and all the rooms are well,1
You can't beat brand new. This hotel opened in October. It looked like it opened last week. The rooms all have kitchenettes. We appreciated the fridge and the microwave. The room (the entire hotel) was immaculate and the staff was friendly. The rate includes continental breakfast (our favorite meal). We were there to visit FSU which is about ten minutes... More,1

"Very dubious about our stay here as had read very mixed reviews. The hotel is situated in a commercial/industrial area, so is very quiet in the evenings. The subway is a 2 min walk away and there a dew convenience stores close-by, includung a delicious chinese bakery. The hotel was very clean and welcoming. all staff were helpful. They printed... More",1
"We were very pleased with the room and thought the location of the hotel was great. It was a no hassle experience to bring our dog which was wonderful. The only negative was that they couldn't find our reservation right away, but that may have been because we have a two part last name.",1
"We stayed this hotel because it is close to LAX airport. However, most of our activities this time is not near the hotel. The check in staffs were friendly. We used Marriott app to confirm the hotel. The room keys were ready by 2PM as we specified. The room size is kind of small compared to other Springhill suite. And... More",1

It was a good clean stay.,1

We recently had our meeting at this location and they took great care of us. Ivana made the rental process easy and painless. Then there was... More",1
For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.,1
"This hotel is easy to find, and the staff is very accommodating . It is very close to a great neighborhood restaurant. It is very well taken care of. If you stay you will not regret it. I have stayed in a variety of rooms and including the suites and they are clean and comfortable.",1

"What a pleasant surprise! The cottages were neat and clean and perfect for our family of 5. We were toasty warm even when the temps dipped to -28 (-43 with the windchill) at night.

"We came here for a few days last Summer and the hotel was fantastic! Beds super comfy, nice and spacious rooms with quite a big bathroom, and a pool for the kids. It's right across the road from a Chilis restaurant and so nearby the huge shopping centre. My sister and I didn't want to leave because it was one... More",1
"Stayed at this property while on a convention. Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated. Noise is a problem, though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that doesn't face the street side, as the party goes on all night.",1
"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing",1
"OK. I didn't actually put any lime in a coconut nor did I shake it all up - I am way too old for that. But Coconut Waikiki was a neat, well priced and well located place to stay in expensive Waikiki. It's a brief meander from the hotel to the beach, with about 342 ABC stores along the way... More",1
"My family stayed here over the July 4th holiday. We were with 5 other families who had previously gone camping together for several years.

The Thanksgiving buffet was extraordinary! The food was top notch... More",1
"Beautiful hotel. For 109 you expect an average hotel but this is awesome. Automatic blinds, lights, huge bathroom. Nice standing shower with jacuzzi. Great cleaning staff, front desk, room service.

Great place close to beach,1
Colazione abbondante e con molta scelta. Camere pulite.,1
"The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional.",1
"Good hotel, but room lighting is poor and beds are too low and too soft. Good location. Friendly and helpful staff. Did not eat at Restaurant, You have to like stark and modern to appreciate this hotel.",1
"We are fans of the Drury chain but did not love this one. We are always disappointed when hotel windows don't open because we can't get fresh air and must have the A/C turning on and off all night, and that was the problem here. In addition, the walls were a bit thin allowing noise from next door to reach... More",1
This hotel just recently had a complete remodel. Our room was absolutely clean and beautiful! Everything was comfortable and breakfast was great! The front desk staff were super! If ever in the area I will definitely stay here again.,1
"I lost my confirmation number and they couldn't find my reservation, but they gave me a room I booked at the price I was quoted at. Breakfast was good and restaurant area was clean. Housekeeping was great and on cue. Came back to a clean room and fresh towels every day.",1
Great room for the price. The Breakfast was awesome,1
Stayed here after a day visiting the Gulf Coast beaches. It was easy to find with many restaurants and other stores in the area. The staff was friendly and pleasant. The room was spacious and clean. Excellent breakfast. Our only complaint is that the walls are so thin we could hear our neighbors.,1
"The staff at this Microtel were wonderful, but the owners need to invest in new beds! Mattresses we're very soft and sagged in the middle. Breakfast was above average.",1
"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all",1
"Agreable sejour avec la famille, personnel agreable et accueillant, dejeuner copieux (buffet) mais sofa-lit tres inconfortable. Destination recommandee pour famille avec enfants et petit budget mais un peu loin de la plage. Mais d'un autre cote, distance suffisante pour endormir les enfants au retour de la plage et se proteger des bruits des nuits chaudes de Virginia Beach.",1
"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean!

My girlfriend and I recently stayed the night and it was rad. 19th century Victorian style rooms were great. Old style luxury for affordable rates. The saloon was the best to. Every body was cool.

"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!",1
"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference. The pool is perfect, with full sun AND cabanas. There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served. We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies.",1
"We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group.

We stayed here for one night on our way back home from a vacation. It was a wonderful experience. We got the King Suite with a Jacuzzi in the corner of the room. Everything about the stay was super. It was close to restaurants for dining and they served breakfast early so we could get back on the road.,1
"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available.

The location was great. It was my first time stay at a hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay here. Thank you to the staff for making my stay enjoyable,1
Stay in Pittsburgh was great. The location was very close to all the places we wanted to go. Room was perfect. Pool was a little small. Breakfast was ok I do not think the staff could keep up with the rush in the morning.,1
"Nice hotel, with good rooms and beds. Location is not really close to Riverwalk and it would take you a good 15 min walk to reach there. Alamo is relatively closer. There is nothing much right next to the hotel. Breakfast, checkin, checkout and the reception staff were all good. Breakfast staff could have been a bit more courteous.",1
"We chose the Blue Harbor because it's a half way point for our family to come together, and so the trip commenced with 3 families piling into a 4 bedroom (unit 730) villa.

Quiet. Clean. Friendly. Reasonable. What more could i ask for,1
We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.,1
"We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well.",1
Nice hotel... pool was cold and could have been cleaned through the day,1
Good: Wonderful location. Fantastic staff. Beautiful Art Deco building.,1
"This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. I will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. We appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to Seattle.Sarah Junge",1
"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge",1
"We stayed at the Waterfront for two nights in August. Very nice hotel. The staff was helpful, especially the valet service -- those guys had my car ready every single time within minutes. They even had a complimentary shuttle that took us to a restaurant our first night there.",1
"Check in was easy. Room was clean except that it appeared that the toilet was not flushed. All free coffee, bottled water, and bath essentials were fully stocked with clean linens and sheets. WiFi worked great.",1
"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!",1
"We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!",1
Bad: The pool was to small. Good: The spa was amazing,1
"I loved everything about this hotel! It was extremely clean, and my room was very comfortable and felt like home. The staff were also very nice and very helpful. Also, the breakfast buffet at this hotel is the best I've ever had. My sister forgot her toothbrush and they supplied a free one, whereas most hotels would make you pay... More",1
"Great area, very clean and friendly. Traveling for business, would've been nice to have earlier breakfast options.",1

Stayed in room 444 had a nice patio with grassy area right on the creek. Very nice room and beds were so comfy! Great amenities and with in walking distance to everything. Even has a river walk around whole hotel! Loved it and will be back,1
"We pulled in for the night on a long trip. Bed was good! Towels a touch rough. The road noise was loud! We have a 'wind machine' on our phone, so we managed, but lots of trucks, lots of traffic. Would ask for the back side if we stayed here again. Very clean and very pleasant front desk.",1
"Front desk clerk Mrs. KHUU is always greeting us with a friendly smile and courteous services. Rooms here are clean, free breakfast, the safest place to getting a fantastic rest for the night.",1
"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff.",1
"The overall ambience at this hotel was outstanding. The rooms were well supplied and the entire facility was clean and cheerful - but what made our stay at this facility so pleasant was the staff. From the housekeeping staff to the desk staff the smiles and friendliness were always obvious. Daniel, Nora, David, and Shalya at the desk were so... More",1
"Hotel staff has been very accommodating and making my stay a wonderful one. They have went out of their way to ensure the smallest details are taken care of, just to make my stay more comfortable.

"The staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. They are all friendly, efficient and caring. Complimentary breakfast stays open until 10:30. I loved the variety of food and especially the fresh strawberries and raspberries. The 6:00 fresh baked cookies every day are yummy!",1
I arrived Saturday around 4:00 pm I was a bit nervous because I had read that check-in can be a pain.

"Room was a bit small, well furnished, very clean. Very quiet. Would stay again. Right on the Interstate but is very quiet. Breakfast is minimal but the area is very clean. I believe the shower door is installed backward as you have to get in the shower to turn it on and risk cold shower before the water warms up.",1
"This is a great hotel, good price, very clean, very nice stay. The rooms are nice, the beds were soft. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool. It was an overall great place to stay we'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay that doesn't cost too much.",1

"The double bed suite was clean, including the bathroom. It had a microwave and a fridge. The bathroom was spacious. It took a while for the shower water to heat up, the rooms aren't very sound proof, and the gym only has 3 machines (all cardio). My son swam in the heated pool, which was actually heated. The gym had... More",1
"we got the jacuzzi suite, room was nice and clean. Pictures of the room look bigger online, but i like the fact the window opens and the beds are comfortable. Location is good, next to steak house Starbucks plus right off 15 Fwy. Customer service was great as well. Will come back :)",1
"This is an old-fashioned motel where you park by your door, and I wasn't expecting much when I saw it. But we were pleasantly surprised when we went in. Our room was large and spacious with lots of closet space, a larger-than-average shower, a microwave and mid-size refrigerator, and a very comfortable king bed. What I liked most was that... More",1
"We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices.",1
"Came up quickly upon the alternate entrance on the road from Pigeon Forge. It is an old but decent property. Enjoyed the stay and environs. We found the location perfect, not in the middle of everything but right next to it. The price was right and the included breakfast was standard and fine. The desk was usually busy but helpful....

Room was clean and comfortable and quiet. Staff was friendly and breakfast was good. We stayed here while visiting Shiloh National Park. It is one of the closest motels to the park but still 10 miles away.Thank you for your review of our facility and appreciate you staying with us.,1
"Absolutely no negatives. Large room, comfortable bed. Quiet. Great wifi. Quiet A/C. The breakfast was much better than the typical free breakfast. Within walking distance to two good restaurants. The rail road museum in Altoona is close and interesting.",1
"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included",1
Very friendly and accommodating staff. Close by numerous restaurants within walking distance which is important since there is no dinner service at the hotel. Very clean and well kept rooms. Front desk staff very helpful with directions and dinner suggestions.,1

"I stayed here twice last summer and it was well worth it. There are plenty of stores and restaurants near by, and the beach is within walking distance. The pool is small, but very nice and clean (which you don't always find). The rooms don't look like a palace, but they are reasonable as are the prices. The area is... More",1
"We have driven through Grants Pass, OR several times.

"We needed some amusement park tickets printed and the business center printer wouldn't work, so Jennavee at the front desk entered all of my info and used the office printer for my tickets. All with a smile!",1
From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!,1

I chose this place due to the trip advisor reviews and I can agree that it is a great little place. I was travelling by myself for work and I was immediately made very welcome. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfortable. Every evening the staff put out some wine and nibbles from 5-7pm. I... More,1
Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet.,1
What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value.,1
Great hotel makes you feel like you are right at home!,1
"Great hotel, well kept but the room had some strange bad smell, no big deal. Only problem we had a baby with us and had requested a crib at least five days before, and when we got there they said they did not have any available, not safe at all to sleep with the baby in our bed. Otherwise the rest was ok.",1
Bad: smokey air out of elevators. Good: valet parking with security-,1
"The hotel sits nicely high on a hill off the interstate overlooking the mountains. It's one of only 2 commercially known hotels in Bedford that I saw (the other was a Fairfield Inn).

My family and I stayed at the Comfort Suites and had a great stay. The staff had a great attitude towards everyone who stayed. My family and I were treated great and were well taken care of. I recommend the Comfort Suites to anyone staying for a long period of time or for a night.,1
"We stayed for one night on our way to Cody Wyoming. The room was excellent, the bed was very good. The included breakfast did the job. The hotel was great in all respects. The only drawback was the limited dining opportunities at that location.",1
Loved it,1
"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, convenient to the airport. We stayed here during an NFL football game and I couldn't be happier. The hotel was close to the airport and downtown Atlanta, the staff were very friendly (even though we were fans of the opposing team). Our stay included parking, wifi, and breakfast",1
Bad: The room was a bit smelly. Good: The location is perfect to get to Disneyworld. Rooms are large and confortable. Staff was usefull and nice. Excellent breakfast.,1
"We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away.",1
"Friendly staff, nice clean room, good hot breakfast",1
"The Pioneer Inn in Lahina, Maui is a small hotel that has recently been updated. The rooms vary greatly in size, but all are nicely appointed and have great views of either the private pool area, the Banyan Tree park, or Front Street. All rooms have balconies and are clean and bright. All rooms are on the second floor and... More",1
"I have stayed here several times before. Breakfast is above average with a large area. Employees were very nice. The only complaint I had this time around was the extra soft bed. I felt like I couldn't even sit or lay on the end or sides of the bed without feeling like I was falling off, but that's just my opinion. Still a great place to stay.",1
"I went for a girls' weekend with two other girls. When we arrived, our room was not ready which we expected. So we went and had lunch. Our server, Javier, was wonderful! He took very good care of us and made sure we were having a good time. Once the rain cleared up, we sat outside and had a drink... More",1
"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool. As for room service- the quality was there and the gentleman who brought our food was kind and courteous. We plan to stay again soon.",1
"We were using this hotel for a family of 5 in conjunction with Sesame Place. The key factors for us were the included mini-fridge (not a simply cube, it had to be large enough to accommodate a 6 year old, 3 year old, and 1 year old), and a microwave, as well as being large enough to include a Pack...

"Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice.",1
"We just returned from a week long stay at the Americana. If you want fancy don't stay here, but we had no complaints. The breakfast in the morning was fine for us, a bagel and juice, a roll or muffin and coffee, a piece of fruit it was good. The rooms were clean, yes, it's an older motel, but it... More",1
A great experience at this hotel. I will stay there again.,1
We picked this hotel because it was halfway between Tampa and Miami. The front desk staff is so nice and helpful. They answered every question and even came and cleaned our room when housekeeping missed us. The cookies after 6 p.m. in the lobby are essential. Great stay,1
"This year I went myself, over a blustery weekend in late June. In the past, we had stayed here many times. Outstanding view. Rooms are always in tip-top shape the same for all common spaces and grounds. Friendly, accommodating staff. A wonderful breakfast room, as well. You can count on the Atlantis.",1
The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot.,1
I have been going to Portland for years and I had never even seen this hotel (which has been there for many more years). It is tucked away just a block from busy Exchange St and a few blocks from the waterfront. We pulled into a cobblestone paved circular courtyard and were immediately met by a valet ready to park...

Bad: Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4.30 (advised it would be ready from 4). They didn't have a two queen bed room as booked so we had to take a king and a roll in bed as there were 4 of us. Good: Good location and a good price,1

"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York.

"ALows pets. Guests with pets should be more conscientious about cleaning up in the public areas. Stained carpet in the hallway, mess in the elevator. Rooms were very clean though.",1

"I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again.",1
Bad: When I booked my room it said that that parking was included in the price I paid. But when we got there that wasn't the case!.,1

And the adults enjoyed the excellent food... More",1
"Overall, the room and service were of a good quality. However, management recently changed the cash payment policy, thereby adding a 250 refundable cash deposit, which was not listed on the website for this particular location. Since we were returning to Canada, we needed to spend our American currency first and this created a slight check-in problem, which was handled quite efficiently by the clerk.",1

"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance.",1

Hotel was recently redone and is much nicer than some of the higher priced hotels along beach front. You get to control your a/c. I wish we had stayed here for the entire stay. The neighborhood has great little pubs and small shops and restaurants that you might want to check out as well.",1

"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.",1
One of the most enjoyable stays. Everything was excellent.,1
I am extremely picky about cleanliness and beds and linens in hotels and I can say that this place has very high standards. The sheets on my bed must have been brand new.

The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4.

Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all.

We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!",1
"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

I stayed here for an evening during a recruiting trip to the area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything I needed. They allowed me an early check-in and the rooms were clean and modern. I really liked the lobby and its couches and chairs gave a homey and comfortable vibe to the hotel.,1
Wonderful last minute rate. Beautiful hotel in prime location.,1
"Very nice play to stay, clean room, nice pool area, friendly staff, nice location. Everything about this hotel met my expectations, including the price. After a nightmare stay at a motel in New Richmond, Wisconsin, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",1
"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers.",1
"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area.",1

We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him.",1
"The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!",1
Hotel keys are required to lift the gate to the parking area which was a nice feature. Very close to Cumberland Mall and tons of restaurants and shops.

Very nice hotel with lots of character. Would like frig and microwave in room. Other than that the hotel is great.,1
I like this place. It's in a great location and it's a nice place. Rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff is professional and courteous. I've stayed here before and will again.,1
Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!,1
An excellent value given the area. Very courteous and professional staff. We were astounded by the continental breakfast: complete w/chef! :) We enjoyed the since of security with the hotel's parking garage. Let's not forget the free drinks. ) A+++ would definitely stay again.,1

"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback.

"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out.",1

"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again.",1

We traveled there over our Spring Break to get away and relax. This was our second visit and it was even better than before. The hospitality was above and beyond and the restaurant was over the top.

We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon.,1

Breakfast was rather standard hotel breakfast but they had the coffee, oatmeal and waffles needed to get us on the road without being hungry.",1
The hotel is very clean and the only problem we had was the TV would not reach a volume that we could hear. I asked the desk about how to turn it up and was told it was low volume so it would not disturb others. We could not hear it at all. We do not usually have it loud... More,1

"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",1

This was a good last minute place to stay with a convenient location. Room was clean and quiet. Rate was reasonable and receptionist friendly. Easy access in and out of town before driving through Rocky Mountain park.,1

We appreciate you taking the time to post your review. Come back and visit us soon!,1
"The room was smaller than expected for the price paid per night. We have stayed at Indy for the motorcycle races and paid less for a much bigger room. It was also further from the Indy Race track then expected. Room was clean, comfortable, breakfast good.",1
I was on a weekend trip to attend Gonzaga. Everything about the hotel was great except that they don't offer any shuttle services.Most of the like priced hotels nearby do.,1
Our family had an awesome experience here! Just incredibly clean and up to date suite. Loved the kitchenette. Very quiet and safe. Comfortable beds and a polite staff. Very affordable. Will come again!!,1
"Fabulous location. Conference facility, bowling, restaurant, pool, hot tub, and fitness facility all close together AND an incredible view of the Lake. Rooms were easy to get to. My only criticism would be the elevator. It took a long time to move between floors and it abruptly closes the micro second you press the floor button.",1
"It was the most economical, the staff was very nice. My room was freshly remodled. The staff was very friendly, they had a nice little continental breakfast. They had free wi-fi, close to dairy queen and across the street from a park. It was quiet during the night.",1
"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West.",1

Bad: Spa wasn't available. Good: Staff are exceptional and very friendly,1
"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!",1

The hot breakfast was delicious and included omelets and waffles as well as cereals, breads/pastries, sausage, hash browns, hot chocolate, etc...

Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.,1
This is the hotel if you're just needing a place to stay in Traverse City and do not need lake front property. Rooms were clean and comfortable.

"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp.",1
Bad: I needed directions on how to work the shower -took forever to figure out how to get hot water. Good: Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that you didn't have to fight to get into the hotel from the street. Couldn't hear street noise. Comfortable room and great staff.,1

"I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located.",1
"A little pricy, but it was 4th of July weekend so we totally understand. But the price was well worth it. Martha at the front desk was great! Excellent customer service from her! Always smiled and was so helpful. We loved this hotels location too. We will be back soon .",1
The microwave and refrigerator was not working and the iron was missing from the room. I also did not receive the wi-fi connection information at check-in. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nice breakfast eating area and food was tasty.,1
"Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!",1
We had planned a mini-vacation to Aspen and booked the room on spg.com as we are Starwood owners. We requested an early check-in and arrived around 1 PM and got our room with no issues.

Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods). The hotel staff is obviously carefully chosen and well trained. They were all very friendly and helpful. We felt so welcome. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone.,1
"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6.

"Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",1

"The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed.",1

"The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age. It is really close to just about everything. If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special.",1
"If you are visiting with kids under 10 years old you will want to be here. Waterslide, pools, beach toys, towels. Mario and Jordan in the pool area will take care of you. Very nice time.

"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon. Genafer, Director of Sales",1
Spent three days at the Western Inn. This stay was not planned ahead of time but I am so happy with the result. The rooms are clean and well kept.

"My experience with Best Western has been very good. I like their chain especially in their newer facilities. I typically seek out this chain as well as Hampton and other high end chains. The breakfast though good, would be better if there was more selection. The parking was tight and getting in or out of the facility by auto can... More",1
"This facility was very good with one caveat - door to room was in need of maintenance attention - not urgent and the staff was notified at checkout.

The Mills House is just lovely. The rooms have upgraded bathrooms and wonderful bed linens. Very quiet. The dining room needs some attention when it comes to service and the food is up to the restaurant standards in the area but that is a small complaint.We would go back again.,1

"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon.",1

The hotel was very very clean with up to date interior furnishings and bedding. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.

"I check in the interior of the hotel was clean. When I got to my room, I found someone sock over in the corner and a belt under the bed. Then when I got ready to take a shower the water was cold. The mattress in the bed was not firm, it had a sunk in the middle. Overall the hotel was nice but the mattress in room 416 need to be thrown out. I was uncomfortable the entire night.",1
"I love so many things about The Viceroy. It's in a perfect location right in the heart of Santa Monica. The staff is friendly and helpful, the design is beautiful, the common areas are gorgeous, rooms are smaller but very nicely appointed and the pool is small and somewhat shaded but overall it's a wonderful hotel.",1
"My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend.",1

Only problem was the phone did not work and they had no staff to deal with that problem when I arrived at 1 am. The staff did agree to knock on my door in lieu of a wake-up call - which allowed me to make my early morning flight.",1
I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really didn't have any idea where to stay. Aria looked new and fresh and the package deal with airfare was pretty compelling.

"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance.",1
Good place to stay. Breakfast could have been a little better as it was the same everyday. They serve scrambled eggs in breakfast which wasnt cooked well and was prepared in hurry. The staff were very professional and helpful.,1

"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows.",1

This hotel was an excellent pick for the convenience and location that it was in. We stayed in the King City-view w/whirlpool and for the price it was worth every penny.

"Our stay was wonderful.The room was clean,we had plenty of towels.The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel .",1
"Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds.",1
"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly.",1
"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.",1
"Loved the hotel, perfect location for shopping at Chelsea Market and walking the Highline. I plan to stay here again soon!",1
Loved the steam shower! Luxurious!,1

"Nice check in and out fast. The pool area, like the frosted glass but if more than three double rooms go to the pool it exceeds its capacity.

The room was very nice. Even had a microwave as well as fridge. Big screen tv. The only negative in my room was the toilet seat. I had to have someone come clean it and they were right on it.,1
"This place was so relaxing, and the location was second to none. We will definitely be back. Very friendly staff. The area was perfect with boutique shops and very comfortable restaurants.

Long term parking expensive compared to other hotels.,1
"everything was great - location, hotel lobby,  pool, The  only negative point was the awful coffee served at breakfast. Breakfast food in and off itself was fine. Loved being able to sit on the patio",1
"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location.",1

We stayed here for a car show with our 5 year old grandson. The only complaint that I have the ice machine on our floor didn't work. The staff were all great. All the beds are sleep number beds. The wifi works.,1

"Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!",1
"This hotel was really good. The desk lady was very nice when we arrived, the room was clean, parking was right in front of our room.

Centrally located centrally located close to centres. Great place to crash after a long flight from Melbourne. Room is well serviced and clean staff very friendly. Nice grounds with swimming pool. However only complaint is the balcony suit with pool views has no views,1
"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us.",1
"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner.",1
"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price.

This is my first review on TA which should tell you we were very happy with our experience. Value for money in the heart of prime time vacation season was excellent.

"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future.",1

"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen.",1
Dropped by Pittsburgh overnight on the way to DC. Marriott staff bent over backwards to accommodate us by upgrading our room to two double beds. Bell staff went above and beyond to guide us to PNC Park to take in a Pirates game. Excellent stay!,1
Bad: The appetizers 5-7pm were the same for 4 nights in a row. Please provide some variation. Good: Breakfast buffet on the 20th floor was wonderful,1
"Stayed two nights with two girlfriends in a room with 2 queen beds. Elkey on the front desk was very friendly on our arrival, and even sent a bottle of cava to our room to celebrate my friends' birthdays! Bellman (Argentinian, as I recall) was very helpful with directions and suggestions. Our room met our needs perfectly! Beds sooo comfy... More",1
Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.,1
"Clean and well maintained, convenient to the airport, a half mile walk to any stores, staff friendly. Would stay again for airport access but it's definitely not quiet with all the highway noise.",1
"I got a great rate at this hotel. If I was staying in the area again, I would spend the night at this hotel. I'm sure i'll be back! This hotel gives great service and a great room.",1
Everything was very nice for the price. Convenient to the city and comfortable.,1
Always a great experience very nice employees make you feel at home or better love this place..great atmosphere the social hour is great way to meet people from all over the world when in Flagstaff Arizona,1
This was a top tier Best Western Hotel. It is close to the airport and cruise terminal and offer free shuttle to and form the aid port and for a nominal fee to and from the Cruise terminal. Every thing was in working order and their free breakfast was as good as any free breakfast I have had at any... More,1
"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home.",1
"This is not Augusta, GA, this is definitely Augusta, MONTANA! Maybe 300 people, 3 bars, and one gas station and a spectacular view of the Rocky Mountains! The rooms are efficient, all you need, clean and the decor takes you back in time. For a very old hotel with two spotless share bathrooms at a very reasonable price, this place... More",1
"This hotel accommodated multiple family reunions very well. You can't beat the location. It's directly across from the mall, walking distance to several restaurants and minutes drive to others. Yet, you don't have to leave if you don't want to. There's a heavy manager's reception each evening with complimentary adult beverages and a buffet meal: pasta, hotdogs, meatballs, baked potatoes,... More",1
"Located in the sleepy town of Westfield, this Best Western was exactly what it was intended to be. It's a no frills, business orientated hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast punctual and delicious, the staff incredibly accommodating and courteous and the location central. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers.",1
"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else.",1
"Stayed with my family here and we loved its location and friendly customer services especially from the front desk (Pedro) and cleaning services. I would highly recommend it for business and leisure stay as it is centrally located, proximity to shopping malls, restaurants and the Millennium Park.",1
"Very nice hotel with a good breakfast. I wish the breakfast had more healthy food choices. Good location to freeway and easy to find. Ukiah is a cute Northern California town close to the Redwoods, Napa and Vichy Springs. I did not have time to use the pool but I will next time because the summers are hot here!",1
"Be prepared for your stay here. We found a Safeway grocers nearby and that made the stay a lot better for our dietary needs. The hotel was well run, but NO ELEVATOR. They even had a waffle maker for breakfast, full choices of on the go breakfast items. The staff were really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. But remember - NO ELEVATOR.",1
This is a very nice place wit easy access to restaurants and the airport.,1
This is the second time that I stayed at this hotel. The rooms have been remodeled and are very modern. Showers are exceptional with good cable TV. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Very short drive from the airport and located very close to the downtown action.,1
Heating and AC are big on my list of things that need to work just right. The system they have here is perfect. The have a heat and cool switch and with auto the fan does not stay on your entire visit. Wish more hotel had this type system. We left the same type hotel in Lakeland and everything else... More,1
"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors.",1
Located between Nashville and Knoxville it was a nice place to stop overnight. Nice and clean and new. Plenty of near by restaurants and gas stations. Easy access to the highway. Hot breakfast.,1
"This is quite a special hotel. It is unique in many ways its design, layout and furnishings are a pleasant change from the hotel norm. You feel comfortable in your room and the staff add to the level of comfort and welcome.Thank you for your comments...we certainly try our best to make it a special place. We hope you come back and enjoy it on another trip!",1
Bad: paying extra for Valet Parking. Good: The Kings room,1
"Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience.",1
The staff were outstanding! So professional courteous! I will definitely stay here again!,1
"Home2 Suites is a new hotel with modern decor. The room was nice with a small kitchen, table and desk and couch. The only drawback of the room was the bed was placed right next to the air conditioning unit, which is quite loud when your head is right next to it. The room was a good size.",1
"I stayed here on a Saturday and Sunday evening for a pre-conference workshop. It was quite full (judging from the number of cars in the parking lot) on Saturday but much less so on Sunday. I stayed in the king bed executive room, which was as described - it had a comfortable king-bed, a couch and coffee table, a sink,... More",1
"This hotel was great and I loved the location! I felt like I was in the middle of all of the action on the strip. We stayed in a corner suite and the views were amazing! the windows are floor to ceiling and offer stunning views of the Vegas strip, even from the bathroom. I would take baths in the... More",1
"We have been to Beaver Creek a few times over the years, but this was the first time we stayed at the Pines. Well located outside the village but only a short walk (even shorter on the skiway) to the bridge and the village. Hotel has shuttle but we never used it because of the pleasant ski/walk to and from... More",1
My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable.,1
"I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites.",1
"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit.",1
"Was in Miami for a work trip and stayed here for four nights. Overall clean hotel with better than average customer service. Overnight valet parking was 29/night, but thankful for in and out privileges. Wifi was free and the connection/bandwidth was surprisingly better than most hotels i've stayed in for business. Air conditioning in common areas were nice and cool.... More",1
"Friendly helpful staff with the exception of breakfast staff. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. Dissapointed the hot tub was broken and the pool was freezing cold. Not a bad stay,but not up to a Hilton property standard.",1
"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.",1
"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!",1
"Bad: No hot water in the morning. Poor choice for breakfast - very little that was healthy. Good: Great location, nice room.",1
"Good: Staff was friendly, rooms were clean! Everything was great",1
"Bad: Breakfast was not appetizing, eggs were very cold, toaster very old and didn't work very wellonly had one breakfast meat some people don't eat pork should always have two meats. Dining room very dated needs upgrades. Good: Rooms were excellent and very comfortable.",1
"We stayed here one night along with 10 of our travelling companions. Most of our group complained that they could hear partying in rooms next to them. Reporting the noise to the desk did not solve the problem. There was a group of school kids in the hotel, the night we stayed there. The rooms are nice and well equipped... More",1
"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.",1
"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast.",1
I checked in very late and was informed by the very nice guest services rep that they had oversold the hotel for the evening. I've traveled extensively and this happens occasionally and I wasn't really upset and she said they had me set up with a complimentary evening at a nearby hotel if I didn't mind a 10 minute drive.... More,1
"our only complaint is that the hotel staff were not very knowledgeable about the area couldn't give us directions. Also, there is no food nearby or in the hotel.",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation.",1
"Very friendly staff and good location (free parking and free shuttle). Nearby highway overpass and road noise was a concern on my side of the hotel, but it is convenient, clean, inexpensive, and with very friendly and helpful desk staff -- they are so nice!",1
Everything was great with the hotel except our bathroom. There was no bathtub. I believe it was probably a handicap room. Not having a bathtub caused water to go all over the floor which caused me to slip on the floor.,1
"Friendly,clean and great coffee and cake with fresh fruit in the morning. The location of the rooms are conveniently across from police and Fire houses. The rates are affordable. Mark also has maps and pamphlets for guests that want to see the wonderful sites of New Hampshire. I would definitely return next year.",1
"My sons basketball team participated in a tournament in Westminster and our organization reserved 30 rooms. The hotel did a great job of keeping us close together and the staff was great. The rooms, grounds, pool and bar were all clean and inviting. The only drawback was the restaurant/bar. I don't think they were sufficiently staffed for a sold out... More",1
"This is a unique property in that they combined a Hilton Garden Inn with a Homewood Suites (Also by Hilton). They have separate lobbies, but all hallways are connected and they use the same elevators. Staff were very friendly, and helpful. Rooms were very clean, and in great shape (this is a newer facility). Our room on the top floor... More",1
"Carl was great. Carl was the concierge and he helped us with touring New Orleans. The rooftop was the best part of the hotel. It had a stylish bar and a view of the city that you only get from this hotel Thank you so much for taking the time to share this feedback about your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had an excellent stay. You are correct in stating how wonderful the view is from our Monkey Board Rooftop Bar and also about the job Carl does as our concierge. We appreciate having you stay with us and hope to have you back for another stay real soon.Best regards,",1
"In town for family hospital emergency. Staff was so helpful, extended my stay. There were no rooms in this small town due to graduations, weddings etc. General Manager made sure I had a room. Excellent customer service.",1
Great location. There was a lot of things going on downtown and the only complaint was parking lot was full and had to use the valet.,1
So my fianc an i stayed at the hotel the night the front desk gentlemen was super nice an friendly next morning breakfast was awesome. The room was very clean an if you want to take a hot shower. Best hot shower ever. Would definitely be going there again.,1
"This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back.",1
Nice to visit one of the old time motels (motor-hotels) which were the only type of lodgings found along the smaller highways of North America during the 50's and 60's before the interstates and bigger hotel chains came in and destroyed the tourist economies of America's small towns. A quiet location despite its proximity to the highway and quaint with... More,1
"We've had a very pleasant stay at this hotel, great staff and forseen of all comforts, the rooms are not the biggest. We can definitly recommend people to stay here, we will definitly be back one day.",1
Very good hotel to stay,1
"The location of this hotel is great. It's in a lovely spot on St. Charles and it's very easy to get around with the streetcar stop right outside. It's an older hotel and so you do find some of the issues you would expect...doors that stick, very thin walls, etc. It is very clean, even though you will find some... More",1
"Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel.",1
The staff here was wonderful! Got us thru a rough time due to a funeral for a loved one coupled with the worst snow storm in the area in years! They went above and beyond with their great service and making us feel at home during a difficult time. Will definitely stay there again the next time we are in... More,1
"Actual adjustable showerhead, great water pressure, BLANKETS(I know one reviewer didn't have any on their bed), stocked bathroom, tv worked fine and so did the fridge and microwave. The staff was very friendly to us, despite a mixup from the website not informing them of my room change. Maybe ours was better because it was a 2 room I don't... More",1
"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing.",1
Everything was good Our housekeeper did a super job. We were there for 3 days and it was super clean. Left a note saying so for her.,1
We stayed here in early January and I'm already itching to come back when the weather is warmer. This is a beautiful property with a truly lovely rooftop pool and restaurant. While we were there the sun was out but it was 65 degrees...a bit chilly (though the pool was heated) but we endured the chill in order to take... More,1
"Staff at Front Desk VERY helpful and friendly and helpful with the area information,",1
The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night.,1
Loved this condo property. Nice amenities unit was very clean and spacious. Would certainly recommend especially for families with kids,1
"We stayed here for three nights whilst visiting Busch gardens. Upgraded to a room on the 11th floor for only 30/night. The views were amazing. Hotel was immaculately clean,staff friendly and courteous-Suzy on concierge was amazingly helpful. What would you expect from a lady from Derby,England Would definitely return.",1
"Very helpful staff at check in. Stayed in room 201. Had some fairly stompy people in the building, which you could hear quite a bit. Solved this by running the fan all night wasn't a problem anymore. Easy to get to along a winding Canyon Road. Plenty of restaurants close on Wisconsin Dells Parkway. Nice beach area, pool and patio.",1
first class experience! on the metro line! shopping next door!!! awesome sunday brunch !!!!,1
Very nice place to stay when in Asheboro. Staff is super friendly. Rooms are what you would expect for a Fairfield and clean. Free breakfast is actually quite nice with plenty of options. I would certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers.,1

Wifi worked great, and we had a good nite... More",1
"What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system.",1
A quiet and beautiful hotel with an awesome location. Comfortable rooms and extremely friendly staff. Very easy check in/out. Plenty of dining and night life in the immediate area and some rooms have an amazing view of the square.,1

He was very nice and extremely helpful. He got us all set up with towels, snorkel gear, and cabana for the... More",1
Good hotel in the Prince Frederick MD area. The hotel was very well maintained and our room was spotless and comfortable (although the mattresses are on the firmer side). Reasonably priced as well. Having the free breakfast buffet was a plus and a time saver.,1
"First, let me say that I'm the frugal one in my marriage but my husband booked this hotel because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. I was skeptical because it was a little pricey. Granted I'm sure for Bend it's average. Boy was I surprised. The Oxford is one of the most amazing hotels we have stayed in. Our room... More",1
Check in kid was motivated and high energy. while this sounds stupid I found it entertaining and welcoming.,1

The staff and hotel were great. I would stay here again.,1
This place is new and very very nice. Breakfast was outstanding. If in the area you must stay here. The room and bathroom was nice size. Halls are well lite. Beautifully decorated with modern features. A nice restaurant next to the Hampton.,1
Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.,0
After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments.

"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff.",0

Good: Staff was rude to me and didn't recognize my platinum status,0
"Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all.",0
Bad: I requested 2 beds.the room had one king size bed. Staff was rude.,0
"Bad: No customer service and they try to bill you for everything, for everything. Good: I wish customer service would reply to my emails. I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever.",0
Bad: Advertising there is a casino but their isn't this should be updated so that customers are aware prior to booking. Also our room had an old moldy non working refrigerator. Good: Staff was nice,0
Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.,0
Bad: Room was terribly dirty. Good: Location,0
Bad: assigned an accessible room without being told. tried to book room direct with hotel but was told tat they could not match thebooking.com rate (even though we were starwood members.. ). Good: bar area,0
"Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement.",0
"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",0
"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",0
"Bad: Me and my husband came to Chicago for our 10 year wedding aniversary. My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink. Good: The front desk people were very helpful and nice - especially Emily Mendoza.",0
"Bad: Spa (No pool and No available time). Breakfast. Good: Breakfast wasn't ready. No coffee, no plates, nothing in the hot thing. Really a disapointment.",0
"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location.",0
"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.",0
"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all.",0
Good: Ac did not work,0
"Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy",0
Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More,0
"This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better.",0
"Nice staff, room almost too small to turn around in. Kind of dirty feeling, bed should've been replaced five years ago. Can hear every noise next door and in the hall.",0
"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.",0
"Charged me for the night that didn't stay. I booked through Booking.com and kept telling me to contact Booking.com and they didn't take any responsibility. There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through. Unfortunately, nobody showed up for arrival on 12/06, and the reservations were charged first night room and tax for a no show.",0
"I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience. I can be reached directly at 707-257-1930. ext 150. Thank you, Genafer Vattuone",0
"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once.",0
"This place was a dud..Swimming pool was more like a bath tub... The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley. Tip: Best hotel rates are between November 11th and April 30th.",0
"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review.",0
"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50.",0
"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.",0
"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately. Rest assured we will address each item with our team for immediate correction. It was disheartening that your first visit with us was disappointing.I truly would love to have the opportunity to have you back as our guest and show you our true service standards.

"Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking.

"I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com.",0
"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time.

Thank you again, Serina Najar.",0
"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager",0
"Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue. Please feel free to let our front desk know during any future stays if we can do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. I hope we can see you back again very soon for what I am sure will be a better experience.",0
"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.",0
We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful. Then when checking out holiday Inn charged us an additional fee.,0
break fast is an apology of a breakfast..Even ordinary hotels in third world serve better breakfast..,0
"It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke",0
The had a bad smell. It smells like wet carpet or maybe mildew.,0
The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately. The location was right next to the freeway onramp (noisy) and the neighborhood was sketchy. I will not stay here again.,0
This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.,0
The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.,0
Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water,0
This hotel has bedbugs!! The staff acted like it wasn't a big idea!! Don't stay here!!,0
"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out.",0
Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean,0
"I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos.",0
There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M.,0
Horrible,0
"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience.",0
Housekeeping did not clean my room. Trash was left on table and in trash can. Bath tub was visibly dirty and was not cleaned at all. Beds were made up but one bed was made up with a dirty comforter. I called front desk and they told me to put trash outside of door and someone brought a comforter and... More,0
"I was going to be in downtown Atlanta for a convention and had to check in early.

I was quoted a price over the phone of 383 weekly and even used my credit card to hold the room. On the day of check in i arrived and my room wasn't even ready even after 5pm then I was told that room would be over 500 per week and i couldn't afford that. All the man at the... More,0
"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager",0
"The staff was really friendly and helpfull The loccation of the hotel is great cause its only two blocks from central park , two blocks from the subway and within walking distance from cafes and restaurants The building is really old and uncleen and needs reinovation NOW ! The kitchen and everything in it was too dirty to use Wifi was available only at the lobby There was an area to chill like living room on -1 but was too spooky to chill I stayed on the 4th floor , the door of my room was broken and was really difficult to open and close The room and the bathroom were old but clean enough Also the matress and pilow was too small Finaly the heat on the room was too strong and you couldn't control it so you couldn't stay in the room nor sleep",0
"The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room. We care about the comfort of our guests so we'll address your concerns with our team moving forward.We hope for the opportunity to host you again soon for a more positive experience.",0
"We stayed in a King Suite for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. I can hardly express how good and positive our stay was. Breakfast was very good. The staff was always attentive and kind and helpful. We had difficulty with a flat screen in the bedroom and as we were stepping out for a few hours on Sunday,... More",0
"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team",0
"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of. Wishing you all the best!Sincerely, The Carlyle Family",0
"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone.",0
"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium.",0
"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par . Rests assure that we are now working on the issue and trying our best to fix the problem and I would like to thank you upon bringing this matter to our attention. Your comments will help us serve you and our entire guest better in the future.We apologize for the annoyance/inconvenience that this may have caused to you.We continue to be committed to provide you and all our guests with the highest standard of service in the industry. We look forward to your continued patronage and wish you the best.I hope to see you again here in Anaheim Towne Place Suites so we can better serve you.Mary Angeles-ClementeAssistant General Manager",0
Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager,0
"This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!",0
"This hotel is perfect for being close to everything, but that is all it is perfect for. We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough. I could see the lights... More",0
"Hotel looks very dark, weird smell 105 dollars per night. Complementary Internet and continental breakfast. Location is in French area very handy if u want to go out. Small pool of u want to swimming. 25 dollars parking.",0
From all outside appearance this facility is closed for remodeling as well as restaurants. Great location. Hope it is open on my next visit to NOLA. Lots of eating places in the area. Have to do minimum of 200 characters but not sure what more I can add to IT'S CLOSED!!!!,0
"First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!",0
"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS",0
"When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge.",0
"I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!",0
"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse",0
"I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again.",0
"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all.",0
"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!",0
"I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More",0
The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.,0
Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .,0
Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway. The second night another fight broke out. Now I understand the hotel can't control that but to a certain extent I feel like the annex just... More,0
This place was loud and had the most awkward set up. It made it very difficult to rest. Disney on 4 hours of sleep kinda sucks. The place was pretty clean.,0
"The experience here was less than satisfactory for many reasons. Firstly when we arrived with our rental car at about 4pm tired after a 15 hour flight and the need to fill in the day till check in time at 3pm, we were astounded to find the hotel completely roped off with no way in. Seems the carpark which... More",0
"We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More",0
"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business.",0
"Best Western on Pacific Ave Atlantic City NJ was dirty, bad section of town, in fear of our families safety. Never again, I always stay at Best Westerns , never a problem, but stay away from this one.",0
"Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size",0
"This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST.",0
Seriously security is too bed!! Some one stole my stuff in my car!!,0

"Did not sleep.. sadly when we arrived this hotel was directly the msin hotel affected by the construction and its crew, that was performed during the whole night, made our short trip to the beach a sadly terrible one",0
"I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.",0
The internet was so slow that my data kicked in. That I could be OK with just a nuisance. I got back to my room around 9pm and wanted to take a bath. The stopper on the tub did not work so could not do that. I think it is funny how things that are so minor do not work... More,0
"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment.",0
"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",0
"I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit. We take very seriously any complaints of discrimination, any forms of which are not tolerated in our company.

"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,",0
"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,",0
"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback.",0
"For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor",0
The hotel is new and the rooms are very nice BUTthe waiting time for the elevator in the morning can be up to 20 minthe Que for breakfast is so long and you cant even get a seatno poolrooftop is closed in winterthe free shuttle bus... you need to wait from 30-45 min for 5 min drive and 15 min walkhouse keeping do very little - room was not cleaned as expected when you call the reception it takes 5-10 min to be answered,0
"The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly.",0
"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel.",0
"Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one.",0
"Not pleased. Poor experience. Will definitely stay somewhere else next time. 7 day/6 night stay...zero cleaning despite numerous requests, no fresh towels or linens entire week other than towels/soap/toilet paper we helped ourselves to from nearby cart. overflowing garbage cans were finally put in hallway day 4.Dear RobinsU9085vk,Thank you very much for taking the time our of your day to review our hotel and share your stay with us.

"Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card.

"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!",0
"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day.",0
"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action.",0
"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure.",0
"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!",0
I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!,0
Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to.,0
This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service.,0
"Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE",0
"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again.",0
"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here.",0
"Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere.",0
"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place.",0
"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table.",0
"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me.",0
"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.",0
"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website.",0
"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",0
"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize. Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service, but with your experience, we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe. We invite you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future.",0
"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe.",0
"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance.",0
"First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!",0
"I don't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews.Let me just say, we couldn't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel.I did feel sorry for the check in girl. She was alone and it was very busy, but she was very polite and nice.",0
"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury.",0
"I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America. I know you get what you pay for however, this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday. It's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the... More",0
"Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare.",0
Not a 3 star more like 2 star. Small room no fridge or micro. Old style room.,0
Good: The worst customer service I ever had. In life. The front dest worker was very disrespectful unhelpful. He actually was yelling at me I had to call booking .com,0
"Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says. You have to pay additional fees at the hotel. Definetely, not going back. Good: The receptionist was friendly. You can get some coffe in the back.",0
"Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free.",0
Bad: Scam more charge of parking and take from my credit card without telling me . Good: Location,0
"Bad: Pictures were not accurate. The halls were dark and dirty. The floor in the room was not very clean. Did not know that there was not an elevator. Thankfully, we were on the ground floor. The eating area was very crowded. Hard to find seating. Good: Location",0
"Bad: Not clean, nothing worked, noisy, old and worn-out. Good: Nothing",0

Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub. Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry.,0

"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed.

"Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out.

Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated.,0

"If you love trains you will be able to hear them all night long as they blare their horn and roar past the motel! If you're a fan of thin pillows and rock hard beds you are home. On a positive note, the room was clean and the towels were soft. NOT worth 60!",0

Said they upgraded me....I went from a singke king to a double bed room. Not much of an upgrade,0
The photos are very misleading. The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold. I complained but was told there was no other room available. I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to.,0
"This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit.",0

"This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!",0

(I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!",0
"No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much.",0
"We were the only people staying that night. Across the road the hotel had many guests for that night...tells you something, does it not. Also our room had a noisy fan and the heat was hard to control",0
"The hotel smelled funny, there was no elevator, there was no bar or chain on the door and it was hard to lock. The beds are on metal boxes. Every time you moved you sounded like an old metal desk.",0
"This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price.",0
This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here.,0
You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel.,0
"The motel is poorly managed and maintained. The smoking rooms reek of smoke and the non-smoking rooms are not much better. Expectation for a motel are naturally low, and this fits below average for a motel. The management was disappointing at best. Not worth your money or time.",0
The sink kept backing up. The bathtub leaked. There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain. The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time. Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over. Jacuzzi was nice. room 118 beware,0

It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious. It also showed signs of lone term neglect.

"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul.",0

"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner.",0
"Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!",0

"The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area.

"We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!",0

"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up.",0

"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong",0
"The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts.",0

"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke.",0

"For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though.",0
"My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars.",0
"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe.",0
Room smelled waited 45mins for shuttle,0
After finding the comforter was stained my husband asked the front desk for another blanket and they gave us one. It appeared that a lot of people actually live at the hotel.,0

At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is be shuffled around from room to room!!!!!! The cleaning crews are ether not trained correctly, or dont care. The floor in the bathroom was dirty and had long ladies hair all over. I wont be stopping there EVER again!!!! You wanted to hear about it,,,, now you have!!!! What will you do Lets see!!!",0
"My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft.",0
"I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time.",0
I will not be using expedia ever again this Hotel was a dump and if this is what you guys deal with I don't want any part of it. I didn't stay I just lost my money because there was no refund so they said. so thanks for nothing.,0
"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again.",0
"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous.",0
"Made a mistake and walked on the carpet with barefeet,, umm flypaper, not quite. Unchanged sheets on 1 of the beds. Poorly cleaned bathroom. Felt dirty till i got home and showered.",0
The worst hotel stay I've ever had. On the positive side there was a hiphop chicken and fish next door...,0
"We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast.",0
Better maid service,0
"The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road.",0
When we walked into our room we found bugs dead and alive in the room. When we searched further we found more dead bugs. They should do a better job of vacuuming the rooms including behind beds tv and fridge.,0
I had a room reserved for me by the National Guard for july 15th and 16th. About 5:30 is when i showed up to the hotel on the evening of the 15th. I told the lady at the front desk that i had this reservation for tonight and that the national guard was the ones who had set it up... More,0
"When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door.",0
The ceiling was dripping water onto my broken toilet. The place is in desperate need of renovations. It was clean as it could be for the condition it was in.,0
"I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday.",0
"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again.",0
Never again! The rooms comforters were stained terribly and found hair on sheets. They gave us another room and it looked the same. You get what you pay for I guess. We left and drove to another hotel,0
The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.,0
"Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever.",0
"Needs Improvement,Our room had a odor, the toliet leak, the room was not clean that well.",0
"Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!",0
"Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean. In addition, there were sketchy people in the lobby and hanging around the premises. Did not feel safe or comfortable. Would not stay here again.",0
Not going here again. No coffee dirty place and bad neighborhood,0
We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.,0
The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.,0
I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel.,0
Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem,0
"I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that.",0
The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.,0
"When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one.",0
The check in clerk told us they had a report of bugs in one room. Turns out they are infested with roaches and the staff is aware of the issue.,0
It had roaches... Roaches.,0
"I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex.

"The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange.",0
"We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big.",0
"I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting.",0
"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep.",0
"The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings.",0
Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton.,0
The staff was not at the desk and when they finally came out ignored me and took another person in front of me. When it was time to check out they couldn't print me a receipt and said they would email me but never did.,0
"First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment.",0
"When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything.",0
"This hotel is fresh and clean. The bath was spotless--and very pretty. No shower cap provided, though. For a newly renovated property, however, the lack of maintenance is shocking. The television emitted a sharp, prolonged buzz every two minutes or so. The thermostat was either broken or disabled, and since the windows do not open it was stifling. Yes, I... More",0
"Bad: The hotel did not have a fresh, clean smell and the appearance was not appealing.",0
"I've never been to a hotel where I had to pay to park in the facilty. 36 a night was ridiculous, the food tasted like it was for a school breakfast, the hotel for being in the downtown area looked worst than any hood I ever was in. They removed more money than they were supposed to thinking I wasn't going to notice, I was supposed to get a discount rate and they tried not to apply it. The pool and the fitness room was cool. the hotel was clean.",0
Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location.,0
Bad: Cleanliness of entire place Asked for room with view of harbor and got other side. Not many people there so not sure why. Parking securities. Good: Location People were very pleasant and helpful.,0
"Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side. Lots of younger people stayed there so if you are looking for a more boutique type of hotel that deserves the name you may want to look somewhere else. Good: The bed was very comfortable",0
"Bad: Noise, small room, exposed nails in carpet. Good: Locations",0
"I thought this would be a cute, quaint, retro motel but it turned out to be closer to Bates Motel than a Blue Sky experience. The carpet had stains, the pool was broken, there were dogs barking in one of the rooms and there were ants crawling in the bathroom sink. Won't be back.",0
"We are regular Hyatt customers and are loyal because of the consistent quality and service. While everyone here is very nice, the pool is not kept up and the TV reception is TERRIBLE. It is August and our granddaughter wants to swim. The pool is cloudy, full of leaves and very uninviting. Breakfast was also disappointing...powdered eggs and out of... More",0
"I gave this place 2 stars because the carpets were filthy. The kids socks and feet were black after walking on the floors and carpets. Plus we found a clump of hair near the drapes. The problem becomes that you start to wonder what else is dirty that you can't detect. On the flip side, the front desk was very... More",0
We paid 339.00 plus 50.00 tax for a room that faced a busy to lane road..plus the entrance to the hotel...and dumpster across the street. Not a the stunning view of Sedona.

"Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else.",0
"This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again.",0
Room smelled of stale smoke. Furniture broken and dirty.,0
"First time we had stayed at this resort, we chose this report for its location and it was one of the more expensive hotels so presumed it would be good !!!!

I read the Trip Advisor reviews prior to making reservations for a 3-day stay and felt comfortable with the anticipated accommodations. Now I am doubting if we stayed at the same place!

I am sad to say this place is very unhospitable. At least when I stayed. They advertise a shuttle service Frisco shuttle who are very unreliable.

"I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room). I then had to switch rooms and clerk seemed annoyed that I was unhappy with the status of my room.",0
"Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens",0

Shower was broken. People upstairs paced for at least two hours from 2 to 4 AM.,0
"Was promised early check-in...didn't get it. One room was partially cleaned. Restaurant was extremely slow, the food was mediocre and pricey. Internet was really slow. Self parking for only 24 per day. Four or five star priced hotel for a two star (at the most) venue.",0
"I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that. Overall bad",0
Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. .,0
"I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel in Eau Claire. None of the staff have any idea whats going on when you check in. I had this hotel resereved for my wedding guests and everything got screwed up. We were all charged different amounts for our rooms, even after we were assured that we would only be charged this one amount. And the only girl who knew what was going on got FIRED!!! The NON smoking rooms were very nice but the smoking ones were horrible. Also plan to check out ...view moreon time becaue they call you right at check out time!!

Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience,0

Wendy was not accommodate customer's need at all, Over half hour tried to fix the TV with no success. Ask for Change room, she said no. Even at the beginning, Wendy told us plenty of room available.",0
There was no airport shuttle and It was a little run down,0
"This place was worse than terrible! I reserved my dad a room for a funeral and i have to say that it was the worst place I've ever seen! The place was beyond filthy and smelly! They didn't even try to hide the filth, my brother found bed bugs in his room and decided to leave! Bottom line, STAY AWAY!!!!",0
Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else.,0
"One room key didn't work, carpets in hallway and at door filthy dirty, as for carpets in room, due to color, not able to see as much, but, come on, if outside door is visibly stained and dirty, what's expected inside. Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!",0
I have never been to such a place in my life. The room needs a deep clean or totally revamped. Then we had noisy people in the next room. When I called the front desk the night receptionist did come to to tell them to turn the noise down but was ignored. We complained again only to be told that... More,0
Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone.,0
"The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc.",0
"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again.",0
"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",0
Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.,0
No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed.,0
Staff not all that friendly or helpful at check-in. Hot water was scalding and regulator did not work properly. Breakfast was not great. Toilet had slow leak.,0
"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything.",0
"It's like this used to be a decent hotel and they just stopped caring. Took the hotel clerk 3 tries to give me the right keys, after sending me to the wrong room. Beds are not very comfortable, and the heating / cooling is really noisy.",0
"Los colchones no son comodos, solo trabajo un elevador, las toallas curtidas, el aire acondicionado no se pudo regular la temperatura.",0
Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!,0
The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.,0
Location is unsafe and hotel looks pretty old. I used to stay at Best Western but I do not recommend anyone to stay here.,0
"It was overbearingly awful. The humidity and the foul mold odor was over our heads. Thank God we only stayed one night, but seriously this hotel either needs a demolition or remodeling.",0
"Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!",0
"Not good, suppose to be there a freg. and microwave but I suffered and I have two kids.",0
"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA.",0
I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty.,0
after reservation the clerk refused to check my workers because they did not had a credit card at the time and refused to get my info the person that book the hotel for the requirement credit hold.,0
It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice.,0
"Great service, awesome breakfast Poor, old building, elevator was not working for a 5 floor building!!!!",0
The room smelled musty and sink was located outside of the bathroom. We got better rooms for the same price. Very disappointed,0
First we booked the hotel using hotels.com it had 2 stars which was fine since we just needed a quick place to sleep so we could go back to universal studios in the morning. We were not expecting much but what we got was so much worse. When we went to check in we had to give them an extra... More,0
"This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff.",0
"Here on business and there are limited choices, so I decided to try this because of the ratings. I arrived and checked in and my door was unlocked. Fingerprints, stains and hairs. This is surface cleaning, so the thought of what hasn't been deep cleaned in a while is scary.",0
"We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub.",0
Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope.,0

"We stayed in a Queen with a private bath. Even this room was way too small. When I opened the door, I could barely get my luggage in without hitting the bed. We picked the romance package which came with a bottle of Edgefield sparkling wine, handmade local chocolates and massage oil. Very nice! We didn't eat here because we both feel McMens has grown tired - and there are so many great new restaurants in McMinn. If you like a tiny room with a creepy atmosphere, this place is for you!",0
"My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week.",0
Nice location and convenient to the beach. The property is pretty old and outdated. The room had to many cockroaches. Cockroaches were on the desk and in the furniture. Would be nice if the rooms were pest free.,0
It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help.,0

Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working.

After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.,0
The room was what you pay for. It reeked of smoke and the Internet was weak and intermittent. The staff was friendly and they have a continental breakfast. Close to the Opry Mills Mall and lots of food options.,0
"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for.",0
terrible staff was hateful air condition didn't work and the rooms were not cleaned,0
"Room was a little scary. Someone or something had been locked in the bathroom, it was all scratched up and grimy. Ewww.",0
Hotel was probably built in the 50's. Needs serious update. Not really clean but not too terribly filthy. Landscaping was nice in the garden area and the pool was fairly nice but showed its age. The plus side is that you are literally steps away from the beach. We only stayed one night because we didn't sleep very well in... More,0
Do not stay here!!! THIS IS THE WORST! I had a horrible experience. The hotel is smells like fish. Their is a swamp located outside the door that you enter your room. Management does not call you back when you have problems. I had to call the corporate office in order to get a call back from them.The tub got... More,0
The Hotel Laguna has location -- on the beach and in downtown Laguna. That's about all it has the facility is very tired and in need of a complete renovation. It does not provide the level of service that I expect of a hotel that charges what it does. Among the many annoying features are paper thin walls that leave... More,0
"Room smelled musty. No elevator, and very second rate breakfast. Definitely not worth the price.",0
"This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)",0
I had a terrible experience with this hotel. I did not have towel rack or telephone in my room. Also there was an issue with the cleanliness of the room.,0
"Even though its non smoking rooms, first room had an odor. They changed rooms..odor was not as bad. Bed was not comfortable.",0
"Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park. Room stank like feet, bathroom had stains on the wall, light fixtures nearly falling off the wall, carpets were very stained. Overall horrible hotel",0
I could not get connected to wi-fi. They had to change my room because there was not any hot water. There was not any food available for lunch. The night time manager was very rude. The day-time manager was very nice and helpful and so was the breakfast waitress. I was not very happy with my stay.,0
"I am not sure who wrote the reviews on this place nor when they were written. evidently they have not been there recently. The outside looks very good but, beware! The man at the register was unhappy and it showed. The rooms he assigned us had not been cleaned, beds unmade and had a horrendous odor. The swimming pool was... More",0

More",0
I agree with everybody that rated this hotel low. It is pretty bad my wife did not feel safe and the room had a musty smell. Staff was ok but location and people around was scary. We ate our dinner and promptly left. Did not even bother try to get our money back.,0
"Right on the highway to Laredo,but rooms set back from road.rooms very overpriced for what you get and not to clean. There was evidence of cockroaches in the room and bed linen had seen better days, very old and grey. There was debris from some rooms lying outside the cabins which could be a trip hazard although the car park/yard... More",0
The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges.,0
The hotel was very clean and was very comfortable. It seems to have been kept up real well. I would've gave this place a higher rating but I felt disrespected by a bald man that serves the breakfast. I went into get breakfast and he was just standing there staring at me. he kept offering me more food and following... More,0

We are DVC members for the past 3 years and have had great experiences before this trip in late November. We had almost 500 taken from our room during our one cleaning experience.

"The hotel is lovely looking from the outside, the grounds are beautiful but the rooms are dated, dark! We had a Jr. Suite with hopes of having a place we could relax in. The suite was not inviting. The bus transportation to the parks was not always as described (leaving every 20 min) three of the days was good ... More",0
"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!",0
"Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",0
"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable.",0
My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton,0
This hotel is not up to my standards. The heating/cooling system was extremely loud and woke me up several times during the night. The hotel reception desk clerk was not helpful at all. The quality of food items for the breakfast buffet were very limited and not very good.,0
"We spent about 16-17 hours traveling 1,000s of miles before reaching the hotel. It was our first time in California as a family and the first time we had traveled that far with our toddler. We got to our hotel room at 8:00 that night and were getting settled in when we had a knock on our door. We were... More",0
"Hotel was under construction and smelled bad and was very messy. On top of that the staff was bad. We were in a rush and needed a cab to get to an event. We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab.",0
"Pluses: location, all suites Minuses: Rude and unhelpful staff, worst breakfast selection and coffee quality of any Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in",0
"I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service.",0
"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money.",0
"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price .",0
"Wat een desolate toestand. Achterstallig onderhoud in het kwadraat in een desolate omgeving. Vieze lucht als je binnenkomt. Tijdens verblijf nog brand op een andere verdieping, geen noodplan geen enkele coordinatie. Risicovol om daar te slapen!! Het eten was zeer slecht!",0
They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people.,0
"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot.",0
"This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future",0
The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in. The wifi didn't work the front desk gave us a 1800 number to call so we could ask them to reset it. I would not stay here again.,0
"Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs.",0
There was Hair in the pool there was hair in the bathroom there was hair in the hotel room there was hair everywhere. There was a night club in the hotel of some sort that made it impossible to park and made my 2 kids and I feel unsafe in the parking lot.,0
When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.,0
Guest services was amazing. The condition of the hotel left much to be desired.,0
"The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot",0
The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.,0
"I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again.",0
Arrived and had prev reqd a king or queen suite and was given a wheelchair accessible dble. And was told that's all they had. However a couple that were friends of mine later called and made a reserv and recvd a king suite! Additionally our heat was broken all week end and it was quite chilly. They attempted to repair twice w/no luck.,0
"There City of Baltimore was having a water problem because of the extreme cold temps. The desk staff did not tell us at checkin that we may have a water problem in the room. We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore.",0
"Old building, the door didnt close properly you could see the light of the hallway through the side of the door, there was a love cockroach in the bed our first night.",0
"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star.",0
"The room was not clean my wife had to clean the tub in the bathroom,and around the toilet the carpets were dirty, the t.v. kept blanking out and the WiFi didn't work.",0
"If you're on an extreme budget then stay! Or just for one night!!! But, I'd pay the extra money and stay at the Marriott otherwise... It wasn't that clean: the carpet, walls, the place needs up grading",0
this hotel was dumpy. the layout was strange. I will probably never stay at a La Quinta again.,0
My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car.,0
"Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve.",0
"While the staff was nice, the keys for the door did not work (old eighties style with many holes. The place smelled like cigerette smoke and was very dirty. The surrounding neighborhood was scary and the parking lot entrance was hard to find.",0
"Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!",0
"When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees.",0
"I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking",0
"The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get.",0
There was constant noise through out the night from noisey doors to guests talking loud. Sort of feels tile an apartment community. Certainly not my type of place for a good night rest.,0
The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!,0
"60's Era building, but updated with microwave, hair dryer etc. No elevator for the second floor.",0
"I had zero cell reception with my carrier T-Mobile. Not the hotel's fault. But because of that, I needed regular Wi-Fi reception. This hotel, unfortunately, had awful wifi. I was on the first floot, at the end of the hallway. They need more or better...MoreWe wanted to take a second and thank you for your review of the Hampton Inn in Gloucester. You are correct that T-Mobile has very poor if any reception in our area. We are aware of the poor internet reception BUT we have great news!...More",0
"Overall bad, bad registration process, had to make the reservation twice and in both cases no email confirmation. Almost had me booked for two rooms and would have had I not made several calls to confirm reservation. Also on the morning of check out there...MoreMany people think that a slightly poor review is a problem for a hotel...this is not true. By letting us know what went wrong during your stay, we learn what we need to work on. Thank you for letting us know and we hope that...More",0
When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again.,0
"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it.",0
"This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada.",0
"No Tissue box in the room or washroom. Room quality was poor. Cracks in the wall in washroom. Internet was pathetically slow, almost unusable, even late at night, very early in the morning. Would not stay here again.",0
"the lobby must be the first place they renovated and it looks great but I stayed on 6 floor and everything in it was old and smelled weird, elevator squeaked all the way up not a great feeling, beds were comfy but I prefer queens",0
"This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor.",0
Breakfast the first morning had molded bagels and fruit. I would check the food before you eat it.,0
They don't tell u when u book a room but when u get there a sign is saying ur card will be charged an extra 50 a night and it will be refunded n 7-10 days...at this point its too late to cancel because they will charge u anyway...so that's y the price seems cheap but n the end ur paying more and its higher than other places..,0
"this is not a 3 star hotel - on top of cleanliness issues, we had a two issues with wake up calls. One 2 hours early and the other which didn't come at all.",0
"Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open.",0
"We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon.",0
Just stayed as had to catch a flight at BWI airport after a long drive. I would rate this a 2 star hotel.,0
"The ac unit was broke in the room so we were forced to open the back door and listen to the highway noise all night. Bed sheets were stained and room maintenance needed done witb broken outlets, lamp shades, etc.",0
"I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning.",0
"A little hard to get to, nothing in the immediate area - like within walking distance. A little old and outdated looking.",0
"There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel.",0
"After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable.",0
"I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed.",0
"The room was clean and comfortable but the hotel halls etc. were messy and looked liked they werent cleaned on a regular basis. The breakfast was a joke. Three types of sugary cereal, no toast or yogurt.",0
not good,0
Room had extremely Small beds and windows were single glazed backing onto busy road so very noisey all night Bins were not emptied in 3 night stay Carpets looked really stained and need replacing over all Hotel needs makeover and maintenance jobs as taps leaky and everything run down,0
I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down.,0
"I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!",0
"although the staff were very accomodating, the hotel itself was old, needed renovation. lobby was gorgeous but the rooms inconsistent. hot water takes 10 - 15 minutes to come to the tap.",0
The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights.,0
"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply.",0
Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues.,0
"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else.",0
Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am.,0
"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals.",0
Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all. Exercise room has no sweat towels or sanitizer towels which we have never seen before. Room was slightly dirty upon arrival. No room service during the stay. Had to ask for extra towels and toilet... More,0
"I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More",0
"The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ...",0
Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need.,0
"I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!",0
The room was dirty it was hair everywhere the counter and table was sticky the shower made a really loud noise when you turn it on just not a good experience,0
The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!,0
The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.,0
Came for a sporting event. Hotel is old and dated but clean. They are in the middle of renovating it.,0
"Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!",0
"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street.",0
It needs to be renovated.,0
Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront. The rooms were somewhat smaller and from the orbitz website it looked like the room would be separated into 2 areas - 1 bedroom 1 TV/dining area w/couch. Apparently those rooms are only available across the street from the ocean.,0
Business as usual. Nothing special about this hotel except its location. It needs a major facelift.,0
I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.,0
"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty.",0
"The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL.",0
Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.,0
"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring.",0
"We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough.",0
"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel.",0
"I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable",0
Please look at Google reviews for TRUE REVIEW!,0
"The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered.",0
I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.,0
I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .,0
Expedia and I the Purchase of Service Not Rendered and Paid For..hummm What do you Think I bought INSURANCE from EXPEDIA what a JOKE - YOU GUYS ARE FUNNY NOT SO MUCH,0
"When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever.",0
"The bed was broken , there was no hot water nd when I Asked for another room they said no",0
very lousy front desk,0
I was very uncomfortable after seeing ants in my room and the tub acrylic was chipping away... This stay was not sanitary!!! We moved to another room but my comfort level was gone!!! I just felt dirty!!! I expected a better stay for the price I paid.,0
"There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again.",0
"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning.",0
"Wants to charge extra for everything. Micro wave, Refrigirator and glass of water. Have to wait 15 minutes to get hot water. Also another 15 minutes to bath tub water to drain. We book all most 25 rooms all the same story with bath tub.",0
"Very tired hotel. Floors were cement hard, covered with a thin rug - no pad underneath.",0
The internet was broke for one night The staff were not helpful and almost rude The toilet also borke Totally not good experience,0
no hubo agua caliente ninguna de las 3 noches que nos hospedamos. Nos quejamos reiteradamente con el gerente y no brindo ninguna solucion.,0
"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there.",0
"The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.",0
"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately.",0
The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad,0
"If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it.",0
Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.,0
"The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either.",0
"Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard.",0
"Part of hotel was under renovation, it was also noisy. Not a good bargain.",0
"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again.",0
"Our room smelled like cigarette and it was dingy! Thankfully the manager was willing to give us a new room and upgraded to a suite. I think ALL the carpet needs to be replaced in all the rooms. This place should be categorized as a motel, not a hotel. Staff was nice though.",0
"don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for.",0
"I rented a non-smoking room for 4 days. Soon as I opened the door, it smelled like smoke. The door handle for the bathroom kept falling apart. Management never fixed. Everytime I exchanged towels for clean ones, there was an issue with them. I had to wait 16 hours, for 2 towels! Very disappointed.",0
"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!",0
"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again.",0
Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.,0
They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!,0
"2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep.",0
The bed in room 305 had to be the worst bed I've ever slept in. NOT HAPPY. not impressed. will not be staying there or will do my best to avoid another holiday inn express.,0
"Hotel is under renovations and you would not know it the way the staff, front desk and sales treated you. The room was great, much space. I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,",0
"The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy.",0
"Stayed 2 double beds suite for 2 nights. The location is good however, it was not worth for almost 200/ night. Overall, this hotel is so old..it needs some update on furniture, carpet, kitchen and bathroom. Bathroom was so small and dirty hairs on the bathtub and spider webs on ceiling... Carpet and furniture were so old and sticky. Gas stove wasn't working. Pots and cooking utensils seems like it's from someone's garbage. We booked this hotel for kitchen but we had to go out to eat...and there is only 1 restaurant near by...",0
"They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it.",0
The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again.,0
"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM",0
Coffee Pot Leaks and does not make HOT coffee. Had to request Toilet Paper TWICE. NOT the Worst we've stayed but FAR FROM THE BEST for that price.,0
"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything.",0
"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel.",0
"Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat. Hotel staff was overheard telling others to Shut your mouth. Reception was not manned had to wait 15 minutes for check-in and longer for check-out before staff arrived..",0
"Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all.",0
"Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time.",0

I have never had to ask for a refund due to cleanliness of room. I asked for a refund on this very dirty room. The attendant lady was violently screaming and refused to give me a refund. She forced me to wait for her to arrive at the room to retrieve my belongings. She was screaming incessantly. I told her... More,0
We checked in late Tuesday as we were in town for a funeral. We chose to stay here b/c it was close. First room key wouldn't work. The second one did but only that night. Every day we have been here we've had to make a trip downstairs to get a new key b/c they never work by the time... More,0

It took at least 30 minutes to get checked in. then my key cards would not work. we went to a concert and showed back up at the hotel around midnight and the whole building smelled like poop. Just checked my bank account and they charged me twice for the room. not pleased at all,0
"I checked in and this room was literally disgusting. We checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. I could never sleep at a place like this. The room smelled of mildew and cigarette smoke. The bedding was stained and not fresh. Please go to another hotel, this one is not worth the hassle.",0
"First let me say what was good at the hotel. When I checked in the gentlemen at the front desk were very friendly but never saw them again. Second, the lady that did breakfast service every morning was very sweet and always treated us well. The bed in my room was also one of the most comfortable hotel beds I... More",0

Absolutely rude front desk clerk. We arrived at 5pm and this lady clerk was condescending and positively RUDE.............So rude we cancelled our stay at this place to stay at the Best Western. Stear clear.,0

The room was not well maintained. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been swept or cleaned in a while. The room looked like it never had a real deep cleaning. The Towels in the bathroom where a grungy gray. It is not a well kept property. The breakfast pantry had a foul odor coming from it. I realize that... More,0

Donna, at the front desk, said she'd be right up. After waiting 10 minutes, I called back down to see when she anticipated coming... More",0
Stayed hare for a night as all else was full. Staff was friendly and easy check in. Breakfast was very disappointing. Little choice and not fresh. The room to the front was noisy and not clean. Bath room was part of room which made the room damp! Wifi and access to highway easy. Parking ok.,0
"We read the other reviews on this motel and chose it based on these reviews, the pricing and the location, as it was right on our way to Vermont.

Stayed here back in October and planned a wonderful review. I spoke too soon.

"Although the view was very nice, the efficiency room facing the cove left a lot to be desired. There were only 3 forks and one butter knife in the drawer, nothing sharp enough for a grilled steak so that plan was scrapped. The room was miniscule and not very clean. There was mold on the inside of the fridge along... More",0
The members at desk were very nice but if your a clean freak then i wouldnt recommend staying here. maybe if all you plan on doing is getting some rest because the shower and floor isnt in great condition. I also had a brown stain on one of my pillows. sheets are a bit out dated.,0
"We stayed in this place 2 years ago. We were in the front building and paid about 70. Since we were doing the Sebring 12 Hour Race, this price was reasonable even in light of what you got in the room. It was clean but dated broken furniture, very thin, chintzy towels, a paper bath mat. This year, we... More",0
The staff seemed to be nice. Internet quality was excellent. My non-smoking room reeked of cigarette stink. TV reception was terrible. I can not comment on the free breakfast since I was unable to participate.,0
"Our priority hotel is Hampton because it has been in the past clean and the bedding is claimed to be laundered after each guest. The Hampton in Lake Mary , Florida was not up to standard. The bathroom floor was filthy.",0
I want to first say that this hotel is in a prime location. You are steps away from the trolley pick up for city place and clematis. Upon arrival I thought the hotel was very nice. We were greeted by one of the owners and she was very helpful. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and we did... More,0
Tub also leaked from wall pipe and staff blamed us for the damage nothing but crack heads living there and drug busts all night you would like to meet a Polk county sheriff's stay here then there there most nights,0
This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time. There seemed to be a bit of attitude because this is the wine country There are a lot of choice...choose wisely.,0
Room musty and not well ventilated. No hot water in show despite multiple trips to the front desk to ask for assistance or another room. Front desk staff asked if I turned the knob the opposite way Hotel staff made no effort to move us to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again.,0
Staff was extremely rude. Shockingly rude. Zero customer service skills.,0
Stayed here for 1 night. Friendly check in staff but the hotel needs and overhaul. Hallways are shabby and the room had a damp smell. The photos are misleading. If i was staying longer I would have most likely checked out early and moved elsewhere. The view over the busy main road was the high point with a lovely outlook... More,0
"Check in staff were condescending when asking which room we had and made us feel less valued due to booking a budget room. General cleanliness of the room was ok, but a few hairs were found on the towels. The rooms also have very thin walls. The free parking and location to Heavenly was very good along with the proximity... More",0
We chose this facility based on location and website and offerings. I was VERY disappointed and would not recommend. The suite was unclean with items in disrepair. Ordered a chilled champagne and flutes and had a warm bottle of champagne and dirty flutes upon arrival.,0
"I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More",0
Positives...The location was right across from the beach. The view from the balcony was amazing! The staff was very nice and friendly. The manager worked very hard and was there all the time. I was worried that she never got to see her family since she was ALWAYS there. She really needs more help. The maintenance man and the cleaning... More,0
Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More,0

Filthy hotel. There were long black hairs on our bathroom floor. Candy wrappers and other garbage in the hallways. We were on the second floor and took the stairs. Stay out of the stairwells. They haven't been swept in months. Unfriendly staff.. Parking is across the street in a sketchy parking lot. Our experience was the worst ever. I suggest... More,0
"Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there.",0
"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place.",0
Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure...,0
I have stayed at this location several times and this place has gone downhill. They spent a lot to upgrade it-now they need to invest in good staff and bring back the happy hour! I was put in a handicap accessible room-so if you need those types of rooms they are well equipped!,0
"Worst Hotel I've stayed in, Non smoking smelled of smoke and my eyes were burning. They gave handicap room shower head not high enough and no sink in bathroom not what was expected, air conditioning unit noisy horrible",0
"The woman who checked us in upon our arrival was incredibly rude and immediately put a damper on stay. I'm not sure if we were given a handicapped room or if they are all similar, but the bathroom didn't have a tub and was absolutely disgusting. It was one big room with a drain in the floor and did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. One corner appeared to have blood. At 5 a.m. A group of workers with coolers stood at the end of the other hallway from us and we're speaking so loudly for over 10 minutes it woke up my husband, my infant, and I. As my in laws have recently moved to the area I expect we will be visiting Tracy frequently but I will NEVER again stay at this hotel.",0
Mold on bathroom wall. Fixture inshower coming off. Very out dated. No guide for cable. Far from a luxury hotel,0

"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out.",0

"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere.",0
"All the staff all looked unhappy, and miserable, I think the hotel is in dyer need of some TLC. Or serious attention. Quite lacking for its position and pricing. Waiting staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and attentive. Thank god the friendly staff next door at the Fontaineblur were there to save the days n nights!",0

Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday.,0
This hotel is old and it shows. They have updated some things but the layout is very inconvenient for getting in and out. The pillows are not comfortable and the toilet seat fell apart.

"The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while.",0
"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy.",0
"We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something.

I had no heat the carpet was dirty. There were dead bugs everywhere. No iron or ironing board. Smelled of smoke. The arm of the chair had been eating by a dog. Will never go back.,0

And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it.

"I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list.",0

"I rated low because of the fire alarm that came on at 4:19 in the morning, we needed that sleep because we are expected to perform well at our bowling tournament the next morning.. Our sponsors are not happy with our performance.... We could not get to sleep after that, but we did try, then just when I started to fall asleep again, the alarm came in again at 5:38 (sometime around then )... So since I wasn't offered any compensation,. Not sure if we will return... By the way, your staff is really great!... The food was great, should have opened earlier since the alarms kept everyone up...",0

We were planning a visit to the Corning museum of glass so figured we would pay more for a better bed and get plenty of sleep for our day long adventure.

Unless you plan to bring dishes and all cooking utensils with you don't plan on cooking anything. They are the only extended stay hotel that I have stayed in that doesn't provide any type of cookware or utensils of any kind. Their excuse is for sanitary reasons.

"I did not want to write a review when we first stayed as the owner told us he had just lost his wife. We stayed one night because of that..however the room was very, very shabby.

So I stayed here for one night in room 114 (their only king 1 bedroom suit) and it was ok but looked like they just gave it a quick once over after the last guest stayed. Didn't think much of it as I was planning on checking out in the morning. I also noticed a small stain on one of... More,0
Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed.,0
Not great,0
"The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision.",0
"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service.",0
"We decided to try the Americana Hotel for a night. Pluses: clean room, comfortable bed, nice TV with lots of cable. Breakfast (free) was pretty thin: donuts/bagels, oatmeal or cereal. The room was much cheaper than anything else available, and there was lots of parking- for free! Most hotels charge 28/night for parking, so this is another big cost plus.... More",0
Keep driving! The other family that we were traveling with booked and paid for this room far in advance. We arrived without the other family and was given a room on the second level.

"Very low rent establishment. Old and run down...but what do you want for 55 dollars We arrived, slept, and departed. I did not see any bugs. Old funky bathroom. A cast if characters from a Fellini movie ..",0
"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service.",0
We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!,0
The night front desk attendant Debbie was rude and unprofessional. She made sarcastic remarks such as I wish you could count in response to me asking for a certain number of towels. I awaited a call from the Front Desk Manager Gary Gillette all day on 2/29/16 he didn't call I had to call the hotel. He didn't care much... More,0

"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!",0

"We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well.",0

"When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service.",0
"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate.",0
Stay away. Booked with Hotwire as a 3 star hotel with a 95 approval rate. Hotwire should be ashamed. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. I feel dirty just thinking about this place.

I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary.",0

I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys.",0

"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating.",0
"We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service",0
"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out...",0
"We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant.",0
"Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though.",0

Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet.",0

"Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion.",0
"Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining.",0
"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.",0

"Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME.

Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did",0

"We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away.",0

We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.",0
The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded.,0
"We stayed the night at this hotel the night before our family reunion. I made reservations, so I take the blame for this. The room was exactly what it looks like on the pictures. It was clean. There was a smell in the room that I still cannot determine. There were many people in the parking lot. It looked as... More",0
"The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much.",0
I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam,0
THIS place was and absolute DUMP ! ! ! They are in the middle of renovating and they tried to put me in a room that had not been renovated yet. EVERYTHING AND EVERYPLACE you look the place is FILTHY ! ! ! Motel 6 would even be a better place to stay than this place ! ! ! !... More,0

"Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel.

"Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up.",0
Pubic hair laid on tub next to shampoo bottles all week. When staying all week room only gets cleaned twice a week. I have been on the road for 25 yrs never had my room cleaned only twice a week. Cob webs on ceiling. Didn't pay 40 a night either I would have expected this at that price.,0
The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned.,0
The carpet was dirty. Coffee in the morning was cold. Chain lock on the door was gone. Reserved it for three adults. Only two towels and no blankets or sheets for sofa bed.,0
Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood.,0
"Worst place I've ever stayed. Toilet leaked, shower faucet was broken. So noisy, was like sleeping on the highway. Beds old and not comfortable. Weird people lurking around. I just can't even explain how terrible it was except to say I recommend t they just bulldoze the whole thing.",0
"The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home.",0
"I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund.",0
We stopped in here for a night's stay due to the fact they had a vacancy. We had already been in the area for 2 nights but our hotel was already booked when we wanted to extend our stay! We stopped in the office to check the rate for the night and the gentleman who I think is the owner... More,0

Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient.",0
Very disappointed. Motel was clean but lacked amenities. I was charged 79 for a Friday night stay. They advertised 60 for double occupancy. Was told weekend rates were 10 higher Will not recommend this motel.,0
"I stayed at this hotel about a month before this stay and was not impressed. They were under construction so I decided to try it again.

"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!",0

"I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night.",0
The bathroom stunk. Carpet dirty. The front clerk was not very nice. Restaurant closed early. Snow plowing was poor and the person plowing was not paying attention very well.,0
First off they way over charged me. Beds were terrible had cigarette burns in the comforter. Entry ways to rooms smelt terrible. Stains and trash on the floor. Safe was not functional. Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional.

"Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time.

"Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose.",0

The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there. It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo.

"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting.",0

"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly.",0

We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower.",0

Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1.",0

Check in took awhile but that... More",0
"The website pictures of the hotel are very deceitful and does not match the actual product when one stays in the room. The pictures are misleading. The staff was rude and indifferent.

We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again.

"The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !",0

There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting.

We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever.",0

"Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning.

They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home.",0

One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there.
